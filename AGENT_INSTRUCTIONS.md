# AGENT_INSTRUCTIONS: Project Maintenance & Creative Workflow

> **CRITICAL**: Read this document at the start of EVERY session. These are the mandatory operating rules for "Keeping Time."

## 1. THE REPOSITORY IS THE BIBLE
Do NOT hallucinate character traits, slang, or world mechanics. Always cross-reference the following files before generating content:

- **[01_POWER_SYSTEM.md](file:///c:/Users/Japan/OneDrive/Documents/Books/Keeping%20Time/REPOSITORY/01_POWER_SYSTEM.md)**: The physics and rules of Resonance.
- **[03_CHARACTERS_REGISTRY.md](file:///c:/Users/Japan/OneDrive/Documents/Books/Keeping%20Time/REPOSITORY/03_CHARACTERS_REGISTRY.md)**: Voice guides and system interaction styles.
- **[VOICE_GUIDE.md](file:///c:/Users/Japan/OneDrive/Documents/Books/Keeping%20Time/REPOSITORY/VOICE_GUIDE.md)**: Slang, technical jargon, and social mechanics.
- **[WRITER_GUIDE.md](file:///c:/Users/Japan/OneDrive/Documents/Books/Keeping%20Time/MANUSCRIPT/WRITER_GUIDE.md)**: Formatting rules and the "Manual" tone.

## 2. THE "KEEPING TIME" MANDATES

### Mandate A: The Manual Tone
Prose must sound like an engineering manual. Magic is data, not mystery. 
- **BAD**: "He felt a surge of magic power."
- **GOOD**: "His amplitude peaked, triggering an automatic thermal dump in his Damping Bands."

### Mandate B: Consistent Voice
Every character has a specific waveform. Ensure dialogue matches their specific voice guide in the Registry.
- **Taro**: Jittery, hardware-metaphors, stutter-step.
- **Hana**: Binary, quantified feelings, literal.
- **Nyx**: Static, fragmented, nihilistic.

### Mandate C: The Score (UI)
Always describe the world through the visual data of The Score. Use system headers and alert boxes to show the character's internal "read."

## 3. CHECKLIST BEFORE SUBMITTING CONTENT
Before providing a draft or a code change, run this internal validation:
- [ ] Have I used at least two slang terms from `VOICE_GUIDE.md`?
- [ ] Is the character's dialogue aligned with their "System Interaction Style"?
- [ ] Does the "magic" use the Five Core Variables (Frequency, Phase, Amplitude, Topology, Damping)?
- [ ] Are failure modes (Desync, Feedback, Burnout) used as stakes?
