Lore and Culture
The society of Ouroboros is built upon the physics of the Soundscape. Law, economy, education, and daily life are all shaped by the need to maintain Coherence and manage resonance. Culture is the long-term frequency training of a civilization.

1. Civics and Daily Life
For the average citizen, the Soundscape is not an abstract system but a series of tangible realities that govern their existence.

Home Tones: Upon registration, every citizen is assigned a "Home Tone," a unique frequency signature that acts as their identification. This tone is recorded in the Unison Court's archives and is used for everything from accessing public services to legal contracts.
Public Calibration Halls: Maintained by the Unison Court, these are common spaces where citizens can go to recalibrate their Bio-Plasma fields. They feature perfectly tuned architecture and low-level Harmony fields that help resolve minor Resonance Drift and daily stress. Attendance is encouraged, and in some districts, mandatory.
Rhythm Markets: Bustling open-air markets found in Low-Fi Zones. Here, unregistered users, couriers, and information brokers trade favors, gear, and information. The tempo is fast and chaotic, and deals are sealed with a shared beat rather than a written contract.
2. The Path of Ascension: Education and Progression
Progression in the Soundscape is not about gaining power, but about unlocking permission within reality's operating system. The educational system is a formalization of this path, mirroring the Sephirotic Gates.

The Gate Rule: To pass through a Sephira and gain a new level of operational authority, a user must achieve three conditions simultaneously:
1. Internal Integration: Resolve the core psychological conflict of the current level.
2. External Trial: Overcome a real-world challenge embodying the Gate's lesson.
3. Resonant Witness: The ascension must be observed and acknowledged by a consciousness capable of perceiving the shift, which "writes" the new permission to the Resonance Matrix.

The Educational Path:
Malkuth Academies (The Kingdom): Basic education for all citizens. Focuses on physical health, civic duty, and mastery of one's body and basic gear. This is the starting point.
Yesod Conservatories (The Foundation): Specialized schools for those showing resonant potential. Students learn to perceive their own Bio-Plasma field and perform the first essential act: Calibration.
Hod &; Netzach Institutes (Glory & Victory): The first true specialization. Students choose a path. The Institutes of Hod focus on structured domains (Melody, Harmony), producing architects and conductors. The Institutes of Netzach focus on expressive domains (Rhythm, Noise), producing operators and specialists.
Tiphareth & Beyond (Beauty): Higher levels of ascension are not taught in schools but achieved through mentorship, personal trials, and direct interaction with the world. Tiphareth represents the integration of both paths, achieving true, balanced Coherence.
3. Economy and Law
The flow of resonance is the flow of capital. The laws of Ouroboros are designed to prevent the collapse of this fragile system.

Resonance Credits (RCs): The official currency, backed by the Unison Court. Its value is tied to the stability of the city';s ambient resonance. During times of great chaos or after a massive resonant expenditure, the currency can devalue rapidly.
Resonance Tax: A tax levied on factions and corporations based on their ";resonant footprint"—the amount of ambient coherence they draw from the public grid. High-AMP factions like the G Vanguard pay enormous taxes, funding the civic infrastructure maintained by the B♭ Resonant Houses.
Key Statutes:
LAW — Calibration: Power without tuning becomes noise. Every registered user must undergo periodic calibration or face sanction. This is the single most important law for societal stability.

The Anti-Siphon Statute: Forcibly taking Coherence from another being (Resonance Siphon) is a crime against consciousness itself, punishable by immediate termination or, worse, being sentenced to a Dead Zone.

The Null-Engine Treaty: The creation or deployment of large-scale Resonance Sinks (Null Engines) capable of creating a Dead Zone larger than a city block is forbidden. This treaty is the one thing all factions (except The Silence) agree upon.

4. Culture and Rituals
The Tuning Festival: An annual city-wide event where all citizens participate in a mass harmonization led by the A Choral States. It's a day of unity and recalibration for the entire city, culminating in a moment of perfect unison that strengthens Ouroboros's ambient field for the coming cycle.
The Night of Dead Notes: A solemn memorial day overseen by the E♭ Lament Orders. Citizens gather to remember those lost to Burnout, Desync, or combat. Echo-signatures of the fallen are respectfully projected, allowing their "song" to be heard one last time before fading.
Street Battles: In the Low-Fi Zones, disputes are often settled through informal, non-lethal resonance duels. These battles are as much about style and control as they are about power, and skilled street fighters can gain significant reputation and influence. The core rule is simple: "If you lose the rhythm, you lose the fight."
5. A Brief History: The Unfinished Scores
History in Ouroboros is written in the scars left on the Resonance Matrix. Some battles never truly end; they become "Unfinished Scores," self-perpetuating resonant loops trapped in spacetime.

The Schism War (Cycle 734): A conflict between Melody purist Grand Architect Valerius and the Entropy Choir (a Noise collective). Their final battle created the Glassened Plains, a perfect Dead Zone where their opposing forces of creation and unmaking petrified reality itself. It stands as a monument to absolute failure.
The Tempo Wars (Cycle 812): A duel between two rival Rhythm masters, "First-Beat" Kaelen and "Last-Echo" Rian. Their attempt to shatter each other's tempo resulted in a catastrophic temporal Desync, creating the Stuttering Spire, a zone where time lurches forward in an unstable, broken beat.
6. Religion and Beliefs
The Civic Religion of Unison: The state-endorsed belief system of the Grand Concord. It posits that a stable, harmonious society is the highest moral good. It venerates the concept of Calibration and sees Desync not as a failure, but as a sin against the whole. Its priests are the High Calibrators.
The Myth of Valerius: Among Structural Architects, Grand Architect Valerius is a tragic hero. They see his attempt to create a "Perfect City" not as tyranny, but as a noble, misunderstood ambition. His failure is a cautionary tale about the destructive nature of Noise.
The Ideology of The Silence: The Silence is not merely a faction but a coherent, terrifying philosophy. They believe the Soundscape itself is a flaw—a cancer of consciousness on the perfect face of the void. They see suffering, Desync, and Burnout as proof that the song is not worth the pain of the singers. Their goal is not to rule, but to "heal" the universe by returning it to absolute, peaceful nothingness. They are villains because, in their own minds, they are the only true doctors.
