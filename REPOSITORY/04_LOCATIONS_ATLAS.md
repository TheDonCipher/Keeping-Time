# THE SOUNDSCAPE: Locations Atlas

> **"Every place sings. You just have to learn to listen."**

Ouroboros is a toroidal world - a donut-shaped ring of existence orbiting the Black Sun at its center. Geography here is defined not just by physical features but by resonance density, frequency zones, and the songs each place sings.

### The Inner Ring
**High-Energy Zone**

| Aspect | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| Resonance Level | Extreme |
| Temperature | Intense (resonance heat) |
| Inhabitants | Specialists, extremists, the desperate |
| Character | Raw, primal, overwhelming |

Closest to the Black Sun, the Inner Ring thrums with barely-contained resonance. The frequencies here are high, fast, and dangerous. Few can survive long without specialized training or equipment. Those who do are changed by the experience.

### The Outer Ring
**Deep/Memory Zone**

| Aspect | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| Resonance Level | Low, sustained |
| Temperature | Cool, preserving |
| Inhabitants | Archivists, hermits, the forgotten |
| Character | Ancient, slow, remembering |

The Outer Ring is where echoes go to fade slowly. Frequencies stretch out, time feels different, and the past lingers longer than it should. It's a place of memory, preservation, and things that refuse to be forgotten.

### The Twilight Band
**Balance Zone**

| Aspect | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| Resonance Level | Moderate, stable |
| Temperature | Comfortable |
| Inhabitants | Most of civilization |
| Character | Balanced, livable, contested |

The habitable zone between extremes. This is where the Grand Concord rules, where cities rise, and where the story of civilization unfolds. The Twilight Band is the prize all factions ultimately fight over.

-   **Feeling**: It feels like walking inside a new operating system.
**Resonance Rating**: **Stable (261.63 Hz Locked)**
**Social Mechanic**: High Damping required. Any emotional variance triggers "Public Disturbance" warnings.

---

### The Marching Spiral (G Vanguard HQ)
**Zone Class**: **Tactical-Fidelity**
**AR Environment**: **Utilitarian / Wireframe**

| Zone | Twilight Band |
| Resonance | Harmonious, Collective |
| Controller | A Choral States |
| Resonance Density | 7/10 (distributed) |

**Description**
A city that literally sings. The Living Choir's architecture and inhabitants create a continuous harmonious resonance. Buildings are shaped to resonate with human voices, and the population participates in scheduled communal songs that maintain city infrastructure.

**Features**
- **The Voice Center**: Where Choir-Governors conduct
- **Singing Streets**: Roads that harmonize with footsteps
- **The Hum Districts**: Residential areas with specific tones
- **Harmony Hospital**: Healing through communal resonance

| Zone | Twilight Band (edge) |
| Resonance | Chaotic, Unstable |
| Controller | E Flux Syndicate |
| Resonance Density | 10/10 (uncontrolled) |

**Description**
A zone of permanent instability where platforms shift, frequencies warp, and nothing stays the same for long. The Flux Syndicate thrives here because they're the only ones who can navigate the chaos. It's equal parts trading hub, experimental zone, and death trap.

**Features**
- **Shifting Platforms**: Ground that reconfigures constantly
- **The Noise Markets**: Where anything can be traded
- **Flux Dens**: Entertainment through controlled chaos
- **The Edge**: Boundary zone between stability and disaster

| Zone | Near Inner Ring |
| Resonance | Fragmented, Ancient |
| Controller | None (contested) |
| Resonance Density | 8/10 (unstable) |

**Description**
Ruins of an ancient civilization that attempted to harness the Black Sun directly. The catastrophic failure left a shattered landscape where multiple frequencies overlap, creating zones of impossible physics. Treasures lie within, if you can survive the resonance storms.

**Features**
- **The Shattered Amphitheater**: Central collapse zone
- **Echo Caches**: Preserved ancient resonance patterns
- **The Screaming Halls**: Corridors of endless feedback

| Resonance | Nearly Zero |
| Controller | None / The Silence (rumored) |
| Resonance Density | 1/10 (dead) |

**Description**
A vast expanse where resonance was completely drained. The ground is smooth as glass, frozen in the moment of total silencing. Nothing grows, nothing echoes, nothing lives. The Silence may maintain it as a temple to their beliefs.

**Features**
- **The Vitrified Surface**: Ground smooth as glass
- **The Dampening Pillars**: Ancient structures that absorb sound
- **The Hush Ruins**: Remains of silenced cities
- **The Quiet Gate**: Rumored entrance to Silence territory

| Zone | Between Rings (anomaly) |
| Resonance | Phase-Shifted |
| Controller | None (uncontrollable) |
| Resonance Density | 6/10 (temporal) |

**Description**
A crystalline spire where phase distortions cause temporal stuttering. Time doesn't flow evenly here - some zones repeat, others skip, moments overlap. It's disorienting, dangerous, and potentially useful for those who can navigate the stutters.

**Features**
- **The Stutter Zones**: Areas of temporal repetition
- **Skip Points**: Places where time jumps forward
- **The Overlay Chamber**: Where past and present merge
- **Phase Anchors**: Rare stable points

| Controller | Multiple (territorial) |
| Resonance Density | 7/10 (compressed) |

**Description**
Vast cavern networks beneath the surface where the lowest frequencies gather. The Subharmonic Basin is home to those who prefer the deep tones - smugglers, hermits, and things that have lived in the dark so long they've become something else.

**Features**
- **The Drone Caverns**: Massive chambers of sustained bass
- **Undertone Markets**: Black market trade networks
- **The Deepest Notes**: Unexplored regions near the world's core
- **Resonance Wells**: Natural sources of low-frequency power

## FOR AI AGENTS: Location Usage

### Setting Scene Checklist
When describing a location:
- [ ] What is the ambient resonance? (Level and quality)

| Deep/Slow | +Endurance | -Speed |

### Travel Times (Approximate)
- Within zone: Hours to days
- Cross-zone: Days to weeks
