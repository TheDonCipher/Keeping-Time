# RESONANT DIALOGUE: Voice & Slang Guide

> **"In The Soundscape, words are just the carrier wave. The intent is the signal."**

This guide provides the linguistic framework for the characters of *Keeping Time*. It codifies the fusion of musical theory, signal processing, and neurodivergent-coded social navigation into a unique dialect.

## 1. THE LINGUISTIC FOUNDATION

The population of Unison and the surrounding territories speaks a dialect influenced by **The Score**. Because people *see* the data of conversation, their language reflects that transparency.

### Core Principles
- **Signal over Semantics**: Characters often prioritize the *state* of the speaker (detected via NAI) over the literal words.
- **Hardware Metaphors**: Biological functions are described in technical terms (CPU, Buffer, Latency, Bandwidth).
- **Musical Punctuation**: Emotion/Intensity is described through musical notation (Forte, Piano, Dissonant, Harmonic).

## 2. COMMON SLANG & JARGON

### Social Categories
- **High-Fidelity (Hi-Fi)**: Someone who is "perfectly" neurotypical, calm, and socially predictable. Often used as an insult by Flux types.
- **Low-Fi**: Someone quirky, unpredictable, or "wrong note-ish."
- **Analog**: A slur for the "Deaf" (those without NAI) or those who refuse to use The Score.
- **Broadband**: Someone who processes too much information at once (Hyper-perceptive).
- **Damped**: Someone who is masking or suppressing their emotions/signal.

### Verbs & Actions
- **Syncing**: Agreeing or getting on the same page. (`"Are we in phase?"`)
- **Peaking**: Losing control, becoming too loud or emotional. (`"You're peaking, tone it down."`)
- **Filtering**: Ignoring someone or something. (`"I'm filtering your nonsense right now."`)
- **Dropping Packets**: Forgetting things, losing focus, or failing to communicate clearly.
- **Dumping Heat**: Venting frustration or discharging built-up resonance stress.

### Technical Idioms
| Idiom | Meaning |
|-------|---------|
| "Check your Gain" | Control your ego/intensity. |
| "Total Signal Loss" | I don't understand you at all / You're crazy. |
| "Caught in a Loop" | Stuck on a thought or repetitive behavior. |
| "Anti-phase vibe" | We are fundamentally incompatible / I don't like you. |
| "Clean Sample" | A rare moment of honesty or clarity. |
| "Jittery Logic" | An argument that doesn't follow a clear pattern. |

## 3. FACTION DIALECTS

### C-Order (Standard Pitch)
- **Style**: Clinical, precise, authoritative.
- **Key Terms**: Calibration, Compliance, Harmony, Standard, Deviation.
- **Vibe**: "HR-Speak" but for the soul.
- *Example*: *"Your current behavior is a 3-decibel deviation from community standards. Please recalibrate or face damping."*

### G-Vanguard (Military Tempo)
- **Style**: Terse, rhythmic, action-oriented.
- **Key Terms**: Vector, Tempo, Impact, Deployment, Overwatch.
- **Vibe**: Tactical and urgent.
- *Example*: *"Target locked at 440Hz. Shift phase on the fourth beat. Go!"*

### Flux Syndicate (Wrong Note/Pirate)
- **Style**: Fragmented, slang-heavy, informal.
- **Key Terms**: Static, Noise, Feedback, Raw, Unfiltered.
- **Vibe**: Counter-culture, messy, "analog-cool."
- *Example*: *"Forget the gold lines, man. The raw signal is where the truth is. Don't let Unison damp your fire."*

## 4. DIALOGUE TAGS & SYSTEM ALERTS

In the manuscript, The Score's feedback can be integrated into dialogue to show the character's internal "read" of a situation.

**Pattern**:
> "Dialogue," Character said.
> `[> SYSTEM: ALERT_TYPE]`
> *Internal Reaction*

**Example**:
> "I promise I'm fine," Taro said, leaning against the wall.
> `[> ANALYSIS: DAMPING_FAILURE // STRESS: 89%]`
> He wasn't fine. His fingers were drumming a frantic, uneven beat against his thigh.

*"Speak so that I may see you. Resonate so that I may know you."*
