# RESONANT DIALOGUE: Voice & Slang Guide (REVISED)

> **"In The Soundscape, words are just the carrier wave. The intent is the signal."**

This guide codifies the fusion of musical theory, signal processing, and social slang into a unique layered hierarchy.

---

## 1. THE LINGUISTIC HIERARCHY

1. **Character Dialogue**: Social, slang-driven, lived-in.
2. **Narration**: Philosophical, restrained, lightly technical.
3. **Tooltips / System Logs**: Cold, clinical, precise technical data.

---

## 2. COMMON SLANG & JARGON (DIALOGUE LAYER)

### General Slang
- **"You’re running high."**: You're getting emotional or your power is spiking.
- **"Off-tone"**: Suspicious, deceptive, or just "wrong."
- **"Stay flat"**: Maintain your composure or mask your signal.
- **"Don’t spike"**: Keep your resonance under control.
- **"Clipping"**: Pushing too hard; losing structural integrity.
- **"Humming"**: Nervous or vibrating with static energy.
- **"Too sharp"**: Aggressive, mean, or cutting.
- **"Carrying load"**: Stressed, fatigued, or burdened.
- **"Wrong Note"**: A glitch or error (Social slang for "Glitch").

### Social Categories
- **High-Fidelity (Hi-Fi)**: Someone who is "perfectly" compliant and socially predictable. Often used as an insult.
- **Low-Fi**: Someone quirky, unpredictable, or "wrong note-ish."
- **Analog**: A slur for the "Deaf" (those without NAI) or those who refuse to use The Score.
- **Broadband**: Someone who processes too much information at once (Hyper-perceptive).
- **Damped**: Someone who is masking or suppressing their signal.

## 3. FACTION DIALECTS

### C-Order (Standard Pitch)
- **Style**: Clinical, precise, authoritative. Even their slang is used with a sense of "civic hygiene."
- **Vibe**: "HR-Speak" but for the soul.
- *Example*: *"Your tone is sharp, Cadet. Recalibrate your breathing or face a damping audit."*

### G-Vanguard (Military Tempo)
- **Style**: Terse, rhythmic, action-oriented. Slang is used for tactical efficiency.
- **Vibe**: Tactical and urgent.
- *Example*: *"Target is running high. Match phase on the fourth beat. Don't let him spike."*

### Flux Syndicate (Wrong Note/Pirate)
- **Style**: Fragmented, slang-heavy, informal. They embrace the "Noise."
- **Vibe**: Counter-culture, messy, "analog-cool."
- *Example*: *"Unison wants you flat, man. But the vibe is too loud to ignore. Let it clip."*

---

## 4. NARRATIVE VOICE (NARRATION LAYER)

The narrator speaks with controlled intelligence.

- **Keywords**: *Baseline*, *Drift*, *Load*, *Resonance*, *Phase*, *Interference*, *Structural Strain*.
- **Philosophy**: Reflections on the "Score" as a prison or a masterpiece.
- *Example*: *"The room registered his drift. The baseline shifted, a slow-moving tectonic adjustment in the local key."*

---

## 5. SYSTEM TAGS (TOOLTIP LAYER)

System text is the *only* place for raw technical data.

**Pattern**:
> `[> SYSTEM: ALERT_TYPE]`
> `Baseline: XX Hz | Current: XX Hz | Drift: XX Hz`

**Example**:
> "I'm fine," Taro lied.
> `[> ANALYSIS: DAMPING_FAILURE]`
> `Current Load: 92% | Thermal Limit Approaching`

*"Speak so that I may see you. Resonate so that I may know you."*
