## Named Characters

### 1. TARO NISHIMURA
**Role**: Protagonist / The Variable
**Class**: **The Silence (Null/Void)**
**Waveform**: **Void (Absence)**
**Neuro-Type**: **High-Bandwidth / Filter-Agnostic**.
-   *Trait*: Cannot naturally filter background noise.
-   *Stimming*: Taps fingers (Polyrhythms) to maintain internal sync.
-   *Social*: Struggles with "tone control" in public.

**Voice Guide (Dialogue Layer)**: 
- **Slang-Heavy**: Uses hardware metaphors for himself.
- **Rhythm-Driven**: Speech pattern fluctuates with local BPM.
- *Sample*: *"I’m not running high. My buffer is just full. There’s too much interference in here."*

**Narration Style (Prose Layer)**:
- **Analytical**: Narrator reflects on Taro's sensory overload as a physical load.
- *Sample*: *"Taro felt the drift. The room was humming with a frequency he couldn't name—a baseline instability that made his teeth ache."*

### 2. KAEL UNISON (VOSS)
**Role**: The Admin / Headmaster
**Class**: **Admin (The Architect)**
**Waveform**: **Sine (Pure)**
**Neuro-Type**: **Zero-Latency**.
-   *Presence*: Enforces damping by mere proximity.

**Voice Guide (Dialogue Layer)**:

### 3. HANA CHORD
**Role**: The Lancer / The Reference
**Class**: Alignment Conductor
**Waveform**: **Square Wave (Rigid)**
**Neuro-Type**: **Hyper-Systemizer**.
-   *Trait*: Demands precision. Literal.

**Voice Guide (Dialogue Layer)**:
- **Literal Slang**: Treats "tone" as a quantifiable metric.
- *Sample*: *"Your tone is too sharp for this conversation. If you don't level out, I'm disconnecting the link."*

### 4. ELARA (KIMURA)
**Role**: The Guide / The Wireframe
**Class**: Structural Architect (Modulated)
**Waveform**: **Treble (Light)** hiding inside **Bass (Heavy)**.

**Voice Guide (Dialogue Layer)**:

*"Everyone has a frequency. Find it, and you find them."*
