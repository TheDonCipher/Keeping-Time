## User Classes

### Calibrator
**The Stabilizers**

| Attribute | Description |
|-----------|-------------|
| Primary Variable | Frequency + Phase |
| Domain | Harmony |
| Role | Support, Balance, Foundation |
| Signature Ability | Establish resonance baselines |

**Description**: Calibrators are the anchors of any group. They don't project power outward but instead create stable reference points that allow others to synchronize. In combat, they're the eye of the storm - calm centers that allies orient around.

**Strengths**: Team synergy, counter-disruption, recovery support
**Weaknesses**: Limited solo power, dependent on allies

> *"I am the note that does not change. Find me, and find yourself."*

---

### Rhythm Operator
**The Tempo Masters**

| Attribute | Description |
|-----------|-------------|
| Primary Variable | Phase + Damping |
| Domain | Rhythm |
| Role | Control, Timing, Command |
| Signature Ability | Dictate battle tempo |

**Description**: Rhythm Operators control the pace of any engagement. They can accelerate, decelerate, syncopate, and disrupt timing. In battle, they determine when exchanges happen, forcing opponents to fight on their tempo.

**Strengths**: Battle control, timing attacks, coordination
**Weaknesses**: Vulnerable when tempo is stolen, less raw power

> *"The fight happens when I say it happens."*

---

### Structural Architect
**The Pattern Builders**

| Attribute | Description |
|-----------|-------------|
| Primary Variable | Topology + Frequency |
| Domain | Melody |
| Role | Creation, Design, Strategy |
| Signature Ability | Build complex resonance structures |

**Description**: Structural Architects don't just use techniques - they design them. They create intricate patterns that can manifest as physical structures, behavior-enforcing fields, or multi-stage attack sequences.

**Strengths**: Versatility, complexity, environmental control
**Weaknesses**: Setup time required, vulnerable to disruption

> *"Reality is a composition. I am its composer."*

---

### Alignment Conductor
**The Harmony Weavers**

| Attribute | Description |
|-----------|-------------|
| Primary Variable | Phase + Amplitude |
| Domain | Harmony |
| Role | Unification, Amplification, Leadership |
| Signature Ability | Link multiple users into resonant chains |

**Description**: Alignment Conductors connect others. They can link allies into powerful chords, synchronize entire armies, or create devastating harmonics through combined resonance. The more voices they conduct, the greater their power.

**Strengths**: Force multiplication, mass effects, inspiration
**Weaknesses**: Only as strong as their chorus, identity erosion

> *"Alone, you are a voice. With me, you are a chorus that shakes the world."*

---

### Disruption Specialist
**The Noise Bringers**

| Attribute | Description |
|-----------|-------------|
| Primary Variable | All (destabilized) |
| Domain | Noise |
| Role | Chaos, Counter, Assassination |
| Signature Ability | Break patterns, create interference |

**Description**: Disruption Specialists are the anti-resonators. Where others build patterns, they tear them down. They introduce noise, break phase locks, cause feedback, and generally make resonance use unreliable for everyone around them.

**Strengths**: Counter abilities, unpredictability, fear factor
**Weaknesses**: Dangerous to self, difficult teamwork, unstable

> *"I am the static in your signal. The crack in your crystal. The wrong note."*

---

## Named Characters

### 1. TARO NISHIMURA
**Role**: Protagonist / The Variable
**Class**: Rhythm Operator (Unregistered) -> Vanguard
**Waveform**: **Sawtooth (Variable)** - *Jittery, rich harmonics, prone to drift.*
**Neuro-Type**: **High-Bandwidth / Filter-Agnostic**.
-   *Trait*: Cannot naturally filter background noise. Hears *everything*.
-   *Stimming*: Taps fingers (Polyrhythms) to maintain internal sync.
-   *Masking*: Uses Damping Bands to suppress his "Loud" natural state.
-   *Superpower*: Because he processes *all* noise, he can find patterns in chaos that others ignore.

**System Interaction Style (The Score)**: 
- **The Glitch-Map**: His HUD is unstable, filled with "raw" data others don't see—heat maps of resonance, sub-harmonics, and discarded packets. 
- **Visuals**: Pixelated, high-contrast, feels like a 90s CRT monitor failing. He sees ghosts of where signals *were*.

**Voice Guide**: 
- **The Stutter-Step**: Often pauses to "catch the beat" of a conversation.
- **Glitch-Speak**: Uses hardware metaphors for his own brain state (`"My buffer is full"`, `"I'm dropping frames here"`).
- **Rhythm-Driven**: His speech pattern speeds up/slows down based on the local BPM.
- *Sample*: *"I’m not... I'm not ignoring you. I'm just filtering. There's 14 different signals in this room and your voice is currently out of phase with the air conditioning. It’s hard to... zzt... lock on."*

---

---

### 2. KAEL UNISON
**Role**: The Anchor / Headmaster
**Class**: Fundamental
**Waveform**: **Sine (Pure)** - *Zero distortion, absolute stability.*
**Neuro-Type**: **Zero-Latency**.
-   *Trait*: Absolute processing power. No delay between input and output.
-   *Presence*: His very existence "calms" the room (enforced Damping).
-   *Conflict*: He represents the "Neurotypical Ideal" enforced by the C-Order—calm, quiet, compliant.

**System Interaction Style (The Score)**:
- **The Command Console**: A minimalist, high-fidelity interface. No clutter. 
- **Visuals**: Clean, golden geometric lines. He sees the "ideal" version of reality, where everything is perfectly aligned.

**Voice Guide**:
- **The Absolute Pitch**: Never hesitates. Speaks in declarative, unshakeable truths.
- **Damped Tone**: Flat, calm, almost devoid of dynamic range (emotion).
- *Sample*: *"The frequency of this city is deviating from standard pitch by 0.5%. We will correct it. Chaos is not an option; it is a failure of calibration."*

---

### 3. HANA CHORD
**Role**: The Lancer / The Reference
**Class**: Alignment Conductor
**Waveform**: **Square Wave (Rigid)** - *Instant rise/fall. No ambiguity. Binary.*
**Neuro-Type**: **Hyper-Systemizer**.
-   *Trait*: Literal interpretation. High need for precision. Discomfort with "fuzzy" data (emotion).
-   *Stimming*: Organizes data. Counts beats. Checks her chronometer.
-   *Social*: Uses "The Score" to navigate conversation manually.
-   *Superpower*: **Phase Lock**. She is the unshakeable reference point for the team. If she says it is 120 BPM, it *is* 120 BPM.

**System Interaction Style (The Score)**:
- **The Grid-Viewer**: Everything is categorized into spreadsheets and charts. 
- **Visuals**: Blue, blocky, 8-bit aesthetic. She sees people as data points with specific attributes (`Friend [Lvl 4]`, `Threat [Alpha]`).

**Voice Guide**:
- **The Binary Logic**: Speaks in "If/Then" statements. Very literal.
- **Quantified Speech**: Uses numbers and percentages to describe feelings.
- *Sample*: *"My synchronization with your current mood is at 64. If you require empathy, I will need to switch to a different preset. The current social tempo does not support sarcasm."*

---

**Abilities**
- **Fundamental Presence**: Merely being near Kael stabilizes resonance
- **Reference Lock**: Can become an immovable phase anchor
- **Calibration Touch**: Physical contact forces target to standard pitch
- **Silent Center**: Creates zones of perfect stability

**Character Arc**
Kael struggles with being a living tool of the establishment. His power serves the Concord's control, but he questions whether enforced harmony is truly harmony. The Moderates see him as a symbol of their cause; the Purists see him as their ultimate weapon.

**Shounen Stats**
```
SYNC:    ==================== 95
PUSH:    ========------------ 40
CONTROL: =================--- 85
```

> *"I am the note the world tunes to. But who asked me if I wanted to sing?"*

### Serah Fifthstep
**"The Octave"**

| Aspect | Detail |
|--------|--------|
| Class | Rhythm Operator |
| Affiliation | G Vanguard |
| Primary Ability | Pattern doubling |
| Coherence Mode | Elastic |

**System Interaction Style (The Score)**:
- **The Tactical Overlay**: Her view is all about vectors, velocities, and troop density. 
- **Visuals**: Amber, high-contrast, with "Countdown" clocks everywhere. She sees the world in terms of "Time to Impact."

**Voice Guide**:
- **The High-Tempo**: Speaks quickly, cutting off unnecessary words.
- **Urgent Command**: Uses military jargon and musical time signatures (`"Movement in 4/4 time, now!"`).
- *Sample*: *"Buffer period is over. We push now or the pattern collapses. If you can't double-time, you're just noise. Move!"*

**Background**
A prodigy commander in the G Vanguard, Serah's signature ability is "Octave Jump" - she can double any pattern, including her own actions. This makes her a devastating force multiplier but comes with severe burnout risk.

**Abilities**
- **Octave Jump**: Double any resonance pattern's frequency
- **Tempo Command**: Force battle pace on all combatants
- **March Multiplication**: Multiply troop effectiveness through rhythm sync
- **Burnout Threshold**: Push past limits at great personal cost

**Character Arc**
Serah is dying. Each use of Octave Jump burns away part of her Bio-Plasma field permanently. She knows she has limited time and is determined to make it count. Her arc is about finding meaning in sacrifice and teaching others to carry on.

**Flaw**: Severe burnout accumulation - each major technique use shortens her lifespan

**Shounen Stats**
```
SYNC:    ==============------ 70
PUSH:    ================---- 80
CONTROL: ======-------------- 30 (compromised by burnout damage)
```

> *"I march double-time because I only have half the time."*

### Dorian Vale
**"The Perfect Fifth"**

| Aspect | Detail |
|--------|--------|
| Class | Structural Architect |
| Affiliation | D Artificers |
| Primary Ability | Behavior-enforcing architecture |
| Coherence Mode | Rigid |

**System Interaction Style (The Score)**:
- **The Blueprint**: He sees the skeleton of the world—the structural lines and support pillars of resonance.
- **Visuals**: White wireframes on a deep blue background. He sees "stress points" in people's arguments as physical cracks in their AR tags.

**Voice Guide**:
- **The Structural Critic**: Speaks in architectural analogies (foundations, pillars, facades).
- **Condescending Precision**: Corrects others' vocabulary to be technically accurate.
- *Sample*: *"Your logic lacks a load-bearing foundation. It is a decorative facade at best. A truly harmonious society requires rigid structural integrity, not these... aesthetic whims."*

**Background**
Dorian designs cities. Not just buildings, but the resonance fields that shape how people think, feel, and behave within them. His creations are beautiful, functional, and deeply controlling. He sees no contradiction in this.

**Abilities**
- **Architectural Resonance**: Design buildings that affect behavior
- **Pattern Lock**: Create inescapable structural constraints
- **The Perfect Fifth**: His signature - structures that enforce harmony
- **Blueprint Vision**: See the resonance structure of any space

**Character Arc**
Dorian believes in order through design. He's not malicious, but he IS a control enthusiast. His arc involves confronting the difference between designed harmony and genuine choice, often through seeing his "perfect" structures used for oppression.

**Flaw**: Cannot adapt; if his structures are disrupted, he has no backup

**Shounen Stats**
```
SYNC:    ========------------ 40
PUSH:    ===============----- 75
CONTROL: ==================-- 90
```

> *"A city is a song in stone. And I am its composer."*

### Chanter Lys
**"The Major Third"**

| Aspect | Detail |
|--------|--------|
| Class | Alignment Conductor |
| Affiliation | A Choral States |
| Primary Ability | Mass stabilization |
| Coherence Mode | Elastic (dangerously so) |

**System Interaction Style (The Score)**:
- **The Choral Web**: She doesn't see individuals; she sees a singular, interconnected web of heartbeats and hums.
- **Visuals**: Soft, pulsing waves of light that connect everyone in the room. Colors denote the "mood" of the collective.

**Voice Guide**:
- **The Collective Voice**: Frequently swaps "I" for "We" or "The Song."
- **Musical Flow**: Soft, melodic cadence, often trailed off as she listens to the "unseen chorus."
- *Sample*: *"We feel your dissonance... it is a sharp note in a soft room. Come, join the refrain. The Song has a place for you, if you would only let your individual rhythm rest."*

**Background**
The beloved Choir-Governor of the Living Choir, Lys can synchronize thousands of people into a single harmonious resonance. When the city sings, she is its voice. But each time she conducts, she loses a little more of herself to the collective.

**Abilities**
- **Mass Harmonization**: Sync entire populations into one chord
- **The Major Third**: Her signature interval - uplifting, healing
- **Choral Shield**: United resonance creates defensive field
- **Voice of the Many**: Speak with the combined will of thousands

**Character Arc**
Lys is beloved by her people and slowly disappearing into them. Her individual identity erodes with each mass harmonization. Her arc explores the cost of leadership, the line between service and self-destruction, and what it means to be a person versus a symbol.

**Flaw**: Loses sense of individual identity; increasingly speaks only in "we"

**Shounen Stats**
```
SYNC:    ===================- 95
PUSH:    ===============----- 75 (through others)
CONTROL: =============------- 65
```

> *"We are... I am... We... the song is louder than the singer."*

### Nyx Feedback
**"The Dissonant Overtone"**

| Aspect | Detail |
|--------|--------|
| Class | Disruption Specialist |
| Affiliation | E Flux Syndicate (loosely) |
| Primary Ability | Exists out of phase |
| Coherence Mode | Volatile |

**System Interaction Style (The Score)**:
- **The Signal-Void**: Her HUD is a mess of static and "ghost" images. She sees multiple versions of the same room at once.
- **Visuals**: Glitchy, flickering, inverted colors. She sees the "negative space" where resonance *isn't*.

**Voice Guide**:
- **The Static-Fragment**: Her speech is interrupted by long pauses or vocal "glitches" (represented by dashes or `zzt`).
- **Nihilistic / Phasing**: Speaks as if she is already gone or never existed.
- *Sample*: *"I’m... not really--zzt--here, you know? Just an echo of a bad frequency. Why bother trying to--static--sync? You're just a wave that hasn't crashed yet."*

**Background**
Nyx was born wrong - or was made wrong - no one is sure. She exists slightly out of phase with the rest of reality. This makes her impossible to pin down, hard to perceive, and deeply lonely. She causes feedback just by existing near others.

**Abilities**
- **Phase Slip**: Exists between moments, nearly impossible to hit
- **Feedback Aura**: Causes resonance instability in surroundings
- **Dissonant Overtone**: Her presence creates uncomfortable harmonics
- **Nowhere Girl**: Can step "between" to travel instantaneously

**Character Arc**
Nyx wants to belong but literally cannot. Her touch causes static, her presence creates discord. Her arc is about finding connection despite being fundamentally out of sync - discovering that some bonds transcend phase alignment.

**Flaw**: Cannot maintain stable relationships; causes damage to those close to her

**Shounen Stats**
```
SYNC:    ==------------------ 10 (intentionally off)
PUSH:    ============-------- 60
CONTROL: ====---------------- 20 (chaos is her nature)
```

> *"You can't hit what isn't quite there. You can't love what causes pain by being."*

## Character Creation Guidelines

### Step 1: Choose Primary Class
Select from the five User Classes based on story role.

### Step 2: Determine Coherence Mode
| Mode | Character Type | Arc Potential |
|------|---------------|---------------|
| Stable | Veterans, mentors | Teaching, sacrifice |
| Elastic | Protagonists | Growth, adaptation |
| Rigid | Specialists, obstacles | Breaking point, evolution |
| Volatile | Wildcards, antagonists | Redemption, tragedy |

### Step 3: Define Flaw Through Failure Mode
Every character should have vulnerability to at least one Failure Mode:
- **Desync-prone**: Isolation, abandonment issues
- **Feedback-prone**: Anger issues, overwhelming power
- **Burnout-prone**: Self-sacrifice, overwork

### Step 4: Create Signature Ability
Name format: [Interval/Musical Term].[Effect]
Examples:
- Perfect Fifth.Harmonic Lock
- Tritone.Destabilization
- Octave.Doubling
- Minor Second.Dissonance Strike

### Step 5: Place in Faction
Consider how class and personality align with faction values.
