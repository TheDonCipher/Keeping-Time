# ART STYLE GUIDE

> *"If it cannot exist as a diagram, it does not exist on the page."*

## CORE VISUAL PHILOSOPHY

The Soundscape's visual identity is built on a fundamental principle: **resonance has visible structure**. This is not magic with sparkles and glowing effects - this is physics with waveforms and interference patterns.

### Design Pillars

| Pillar | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| **Precision Over Mysticism** | Technical, diagrammatic quality |
| **Waveform Vocabulary** | Visual language based on sound physics |
| **Function Over Fashion** | Equipment and clothing serve purpose |
| **Clarity Under Pressure** | Composition reflects mental state |
| **Mathematical Beauty** | Patterns derived from harmonic math |

### Visual DNA
- Clean, precise linework
- Geometric patterns with organic variation
- Contrast between order (straight lines) and chaos (distortion)
- Limited color palettes with symbolic meaning
- Negative space as silence

---

## LINEWORK HIERARCHY

All Soundscape artwork uses a three-tier linework system:

### PRIMARY LINES
**Purpose**: Structural elements - bodies, buildings, major objects
**Style**: Solid, confident, consistent weight
**Weight**: 2-3px in digital, bold in traditional

### SECONDARY LINES
**Purpose**: Mechanisms, technology, details
**Style**: Precise, technical, may include dashes
**Weight**: 1-2px in digital, medium in traditional

### TERTIARY LINES
**Purpose**: Waveforms, Bio-Plasma, resonance effects
**Style**: Mathematical curves, sine waves, frequency patterns
**Weight**: 0.5-1px in digital, fine in traditional
**Special**: May be colored, may have glow effect

### Example Application
```
CHARACTER PORTRAIT:
- Primary: Character's body, face, clothing outline
- Secondary: NAI device details, gear mechanisms, clothing seams
- Tertiary: Bio-Plasma field emanating from character, ambient waveforms
```

## SYMBOL LANGUAGE

### State Symbols

#### SYNC (In Harmony)
- **Symbol**: Overlapping waves in phase
- **Visual**: Parallel lines, matching peaks and troughs
- **Color**: Cool blues, clean whites
- **Effect**: Calm, ordered patterns surrounding character

#### DESYNC (Out of Phase)
- **Symbol**: Waves canceling, interference patterns
- **Visual**: Jagged, stuttering lines, double images
- **Color**: Discordant (clashing colors)
- **Effect**: Visual "static", broken patterns

#### POWER BUILD-UP
- **Symbol**: Amplitude increasing
- **Visual**: Waves growing taller, thicker lines
- **Color**: Warming from cool to hot
- **Effect**: Intensifying patterns, concentration

#### OVERDRIVE
- **Symbol**: Clipping waveform
- **Visual**: Square-wave distortion, crackle patterns
- **Color**: Hot colors bleeding, white highlights
- **Effect**: Breaking panel borders, overwhelming page

#### SILENCE
- **Symbol**: Flat line (no wave)
- **Visual**: Empty space, no patterns, stark
- **Color**: Absence of color, pure white/black
- **Effect**: Missing details, faded elements

### Technique Indicators

| Indicator | Meaning | Visual |
|-----------|---------|--------|
| **Speed Lines** | Frequency visualization | Tight parallel curves |
| **Concentric Rings** | Power emanation | Outward spreading waves |
| **Spiral Patterns** | Phase manipulation | Rotating wave forms |
| **Grid Overlay** | Structural technique | Geometric lattice |
| **Noise Texture** | Chaos/Disruption | Random dots, static |

## BIO-PLASMA VISUALIZATION

Bio-Plasma is "organized vibration" and must be depicted as such.

### Representation Guidelines
1. **Never solid** - Always shows internal structure
2. **Contour lines** - Like topographic maps of sound pressure
3. **Direction of flow** - Lines follow movement
4. **Frequency indicated by spacing** - Tight = high, wide = low
5. **Amplitude indicated by intensity** - Bright = powerful

### Bio-Plasma States

#### AMBIENT
- Very light, barely visible
- Widely-spaced contour lines
- Background element, not focal

#### CHARGED
- Visible but controlled
- Regular, organized contours
- Ready state, anticipation

#### ACTIVE
- Prominent, dynamic
- Flowing contour lines
- Clear direction and purpose

#### DISCHARGED
- Fading, dissipating
- Breaking contour patterns
- Returning to ambient

#### DEAD
- Crystallized, frozen
- Solid lines, no flow
- Trapped, unable to move

### Color Temperature
| State | Temperature | Notes |
|-------|-------------|-------|
| **Low Frequency** | Warm (reds, oranges) | Deep, bass effects |
| **Mid Frequency** | Neutral (yellows, greens) | Standard range |
| **High Frequency** | Cool (blues, violets) | Treble, precise effects |
| **Noise** | Discordant mix | Clashing without pattern |
| **Silence** | Absence (white/black) | No color at all |

## CHARACTER DESIGN RULES

### Function Over Fashion

All character designs must answer:
1. What is their Class? (Visible in equipment)
2. What is their Faction? (Visible in colors/symbols)
3. What is their specialty? (Visible in gear customization)
4. What is their condition? (Visible in wear, modification)

### Clothing Guidelines

| Element | Purpose | Design |
|---------|---------|--------|
| **NAI Position** | Class indication | Always visible/suggested |
| **Deck Holster** | Combat readiness | Position indicates handedness |
| **Faction Insignia** | Allegiance | Consistent placement |
| **Material Choice** | Resonance interaction | Damping vs conducting fabrics |

### Eye Design

Eyes in Keeping Time reflect Sync state:

| State | Pupil | Iris Pattern | Effect |
|-------|-------|--------------|--------|
| **Perfect Sync** | Centered, dilated | Concentric wave rings | Calm, focused |
| **High Sync** | Centered | Subtle wave patterns | Alert, engaged |
| **Moderate Sync** | Normal | Minimal pattern | Neutral |
| **Low Sync** | Constricted | Breaking patterns | Stressed |
| **Desync** | Uneven, shifting | Static interference | Unstable |
| **Feedback** | Blown wide | Radiating patterns | Dangerous |
| **Silence** | Blank | Flat, no pattern | Lost |

### Character Silhouettes

Each named character should have an instantly-recognizable silhouette:

- **Kael Unison**: Robed, calm, tuning fork staff
- **Serah Fifthstep**: Military, aggressive stance, dual decks
- **Dorian Vale**: Formal, blueprints/tools visible
- **Chanter Lys**: Flowing choir robes, arms extended
- **Nyx Feedback**: Asymmetric, slightly blurred edges

---

## PANEL COMPOSITION

### Sync State Reflection

The panel layout itself reflects the mental/resonance state of the scene:

#### SYNC (ORDER)
- Regular, grid-based panels
- Even spacing
- Clean borders
- White gutters

#### TENSION
- Panels begin tilting
- Gutters narrow
- Borders thicken
- Angles increase

#### DESYNC (CHAOS)
- Broken panel borders
- Overlapping panels
- Jagged edges
- Black/chaotic gutters

#### SILENCE
- Panels dissolving to white
- Increasing empty space
- Borders fading
- Content minimizing

### Combat Choreography Layout

| Beat | Panel Style |
|------|-------------|
| **Read (Assessment)** | Wide establishing shot |
| **Adjust (Preparation)** | Close-up on technique prep |
| **Execute (Action)** | Dynamic action panel, breaking borders |
| **React (Result)** | Reaction shots, multiple small panels |
| **Adapt (Recovery)** | Return to stable panel format |

### Power Visualization

Techniques should be visualized as:
1. **Waveform in space** - Physical representation of the sound
2. **Environmental reaction** - How surroundings respond
3. **Character expression** - Physical toll visible
4. **Collateral indication** - Scale through damage/effect
