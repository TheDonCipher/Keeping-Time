# THE SOUNDSCAPE: Power System Bible

> **"Power is clarity under pressure."**

In The Soundscape, "Magic" is just unresolved data.
There is only **Resonance**—the fundamental operating system of reality.
Users interact with this system via the **Neural-Acoustic Interface (NAI)**, which renders the physics of the world as a navigable Augmented Reality HUD known as **"The Score."**

To the Unawakened, a shout is just noise.
To a User, it is a localized packet of high-amplitude data that can be read, countered, and deleted.

---

## INTERFACE MECHANICS: THE SCORE

The power system is mediated through a visual/auditory UI. This provides **Explicit Social and Physical Data** to the user.

### 1. Social Tagging (Social Prosthetic)
The Score analyzes micro-expressions and vocal formants to tag intent.
-   **Aggression Detection**: Red halos / Sharp jagged overlays.
-   **Deception**: Jittery carrier waves.
-   **Sarcasm**: Explicit text warnings `[> DETECTED: IRONY]`.
> *Benefit*: Removes social ambiguity. The user does not need to guess intent; they read the data.

### 2. Manual Calibration (Stimming)
Repetitive somatic actions (tapping, humming, rocking) are **Technical Requirements**.
-   **Tapping**: Syncs internal clock to external refresh rate.
-   **Humming**: Stabilizes internal frequency against interference.
-   **Rocking**: Gyroscopic physical grounding.
> *Lore*: High-level users are *more* prone to these behaviors, not less. Staying still is inefficient.

### 3. Masking as Damping
-   **Masking**: The act of suppressing one's natural frequency to fit social norms.
-   **Mechanic**: High Damping cost. Masking drains "CPU" (Mental Energy).
-   **Unmasking**: Dropping the Damping field allows for maximum power output but risks sensory overload.

## The Prime Law: Resonance Conservation

> **"Coherence cannot be created, only redistributed."**

This is the foundational truth of The Soundscape. Every act of power, every moment of perfect sync, comes at a cost. To bring clarity to one place is to drain it from another. To amplify your signal is to weaken something else.

### Implications
- **No free power**: Every ability has a source and a sink
- **Ecological balance**: Overuse of resonance can deaden entire regions
- **Sacrifice mechanics**: The strongest techniques require giving something up
- **Political tension**: Factions fight over resonance-rich territories

## The Five Core Variables

All resonance manipulation comes down to controlling these five aspects:

### 1. FREQUENCY
**What you resonate WITH**

| Aspect | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| Definition | The pitch/identity of your Bio-Plasma field |
| High Frequency | Sharp, cutting, precise, short-range |
| Low Frequency | Deep, pervasive, slow, long-range |
| Combat Role | Determines what/who you can affect |
| Failure | Frequency mismatch = Null Interaction |
 
> **Scientific Note**: Frequency determines the *domain of interaction*. A resonant field tuned to 440Hz cannot physically affect a structure vibrating at 432Hz unless a "Bridge" technique is used. It is strictly a matter of harmonic compatibility.


### 2. PHASE
**WHEN you resonate**

| Aspect | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| Definition | The timing/sync point of your wave |
| In-Phase | Perfect sync, constructive interference, amplification |
| Anti-Phase | Destructive interference, cancellation, nullification |
| Combat Role | Timing attacks, team coordination, countering |
| Failure | Phase drift = Destructive Interference (Self-Cancellation) |
 
> **Scientific Note**: Phase determines *constructive vs. destructive interference*. Two identical waves meeting in-phase double their power (Amplitude). Meeting out-of-phase, they silence each other (Zero-Point). Combat is often a struggle for Phase dominance rather than raw power.


### 3. AMPLITUDE
**HOW STRONG the resonance**

| Aspect | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| Definition | The power/intensity of your wave |
| High Amplitude | Overwhelming force, area effect, draining |
| Low Amplitude | Subtle influence, precision, sustainable |
| Combat Role | Raw damage output, presence, intimidation |
| Failure | Overamplification = Thermal/Neural Feedback (Burnout) |
 
> **Scientific Note**: Amplitude is the *magnitude of displacement* in the field. Higher amplitude requires exponentially more energy to sustain. It does not change *what* happens (Frequency) or *when* (Phase), only *how much* force is applied.


### 4. TOPOLOGY
**The SHAPE of the wave**

| Aspect | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| Definition | The structural pattern of your resonance |
| Simple Topology | Clean sine waves, predictable, efficient |
| Complex Topology | Harmonics, overtones, versatile, unstable |
| Combat Role | Technique complexity, special abilities |
| Failure | Topology collapse = Field decoherence |
 
> **Scientific Note**: Topology describes the *geometry* of the resonant field (Sphere, Cone, Fractal, Network). Complex topologies allow for multi-stage effects but require exponentially higher processing power to maintain stability.


### 5. DAMPING
**Rate of energy LOSS**

| Aspect | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| Definition | How quickly your resonance fades |
| High Damping | Quick fade, controlled bursts, low endurance |
| Low Damping | Sustained vibration, echo effects, exhaustion risk |
| Combat Role | Endurance, sustained techniques, recovery |
| Failure | Damping failure = Uncontrolled Oscillation (Feedback) |
 
> **Scientific Note**: Damping is the *resistance* applied to the field to control its decay. Without damping, a resonance would vibrate infinitely (or until it shattered the medium). High damping allows for short, punchy (staccato) effects; low damping creates sustained (legato) fields.

## The Four Domains

The Five Variablesmanifest across Four Domains of application:

### RHYTHM Domain (Timing)
**When to act**

- Controls tempo of combat and narrative
- Rhythm masters dictate the pace of battle
- Techniques: Beat-lock, Tempo Shift, Syncopation Strike
- Tied to: Phase and Damping

> "A fight is a song. Control the tempo, control the outcome."

### MELODY Domain (Structure)
**How patterns form and flow**

- Governs the architecture of techniques
- Melody architects design complex, multi-stage abilities
- Techniques: Motif Lock, Sequence Chain, Theme Development
- Tied to: Frequency and Topology

> "A technique without structure is just noise."

### HARMONY Domain (Alignment)
**Multiple waves in sync**

- Enables group techniques and area effects
- Harmony conductors link multiple users together
- Techniques: Chord Formation, Resonant Link, Mass Calibration
- Tied to: Phase and Amplitude

> "One voice is a note. Many voices are a chord. A chord can move mountains."

### NOISE Domain (Entropy)
**Chaos, interference, decay**

- The domain of disruption and destruction
- Noise specialists break patterns and cause interference
- Techniques: Static Burst, Feedback Loop, Entropy Wave
- Tied to: All variables in destabilized states

> "In the end, all songs return to silence."

## The Three Failure Modes

Every resonator fears these breakdowns:

### DESYNC (Phase Failure)
**Losing the beat**

| Symptom | Effect |
|---------|--------|
| Phase Drift | Gradual loss of connection to allies/environment |
| Isolation | Unable to affect or be affected by others |
| Temporal Stutter | Perceiving time incorrectly |
| Recovery | Re-synchronization through external reference |

**Story Use**: Characters who lose their connection to others, outcasts, those who can't keep up.

### FEEDBACK (Amplitude Failure)
**Runaway amplification**

| Symptom | Effect |
|---------|--------|
| Echo Cascade | Each action amplifies the next uncontrollably |
| Destructive Loop | Power feeds on itself until collapse |
| Environmental Damage | Surroundings resonate to destruction |
| Recovery | Damping intervention, absorption, burnout |

**Story Use**: Berserker states, power that consumes the user, dramatic sacrifices.

### BURNOUT (Damping Failure)
**Total exhaustion**

| Symptom | Effect |
|---------|--------|
| Energy Depletion | Bio-Plasma field collapses |
| Resonance Deafness | Temporary inability to perceive/use resonance |
| Physical Collapse | Body cannot sustain basic functions |
| Recovery | Rest, external resonance infusion, time |

**Story Use**: Overexertion, desperate final techniques, the cost of victory.

## COHERENCE & SYSTEM STATES

How a resonator maintains stability and perceives reality:

### Coherence Modes

#### STABLE Coherence
- **State**: Perfect equilibrium, efficient, sustainable
- **Advantage**: Minimal energy loss, reliable techniques
- **Disadvantage**: Limited peak output, predictable
- **Character Type**: Veterans, teachers, support roles

#### ELASTIC Coherence
- **State**: Flexible, adaptive, responsive
- **Advantage**: Quick adjustment, versatile
- **Disadvantage**: Requires constant attention, tiring
- **Character Type**: Protagonists, growth characters

#### RIGID Coherence
- **State**: Locked pattern, unchanging, powerful
- **Advantage**: Maximum output in one mode, unshakeable
- **Disadvantage**: Cannot adapt, brittle under novel stress
- **Character Type**: Specialists, obstacles, early antagonists

#### VOLATILE Coherence
- **State**: Unstable, chaotic, unpredictable
- **Advantage**: Extreme peaks, terrifying potential
- **Disadvantage**: Risk of all three failure modes
- **Character Type**: Wildcards, tragic figures, final bosses

### System Render Modes

#### HIGH-FIDELITY (Hi-Fi)
- **State**: Unfiltered rendering. Shows structural stress, micro-expressions, biological imperfections.
- **Cost**: Extremely high CPU load. "Too loud" for civilians.
- **Visuals**: Hyper-realistic textures, volumetric lighting, data overload.

#### STANDARD (C-Order)
- **State**: The default "smoothed" reality. Social lubricants active. Decay hidden.
- **Visuals**: Clean, golden, idealized textures (Marble/Gold).

#### SAFE MODE (BIOS Level)
- **State**: Emergency protocol. Strips all textures to save processing power.
- **Visuals**: Blue wireframe, low-poly geometry, black background. Cold and sterile.

#### THE VOID (Source Code)
- **State**: Render failure. Raw, unformatted data.
- **Visuals**: Non-Euclidean static, "Texture Missing" purple/black checkerboards, absolute chaos.

### Pathologies

#### Resonance Dysphoria
**"The Wrong Note"**
- **Definition**: A psychological and physiological rejection of one's assigned Frequency or Class.
- **Symptoms**: The "Hull" (avatar) feels heavy or tight. Glitching visuals. Sensation of "lag" between intent and action.
- **C-Order View**: Treated as "Corruption" or "Drift".
- **Underground View**: A sign of a hidden "True Frequency" that needs to be modulated.

## FOR AI AGENTS: Power System Rules

### When Writing Combat
1. Ground every technique in at least one of the Five Variables
2. Show the cost of powerful moves (Prime Law)
3. Use Failure Modes as dramatic turning points
4. Frame victories as "maintaining coherence" not "being stronger"

### Technique Naming Convention
```
[Domain].[Variable].[Effect]
Examples:
- Rhythm.Phase.Beat-Lock
- Melody.Topology.Motif-Chain
- Harmony.Amplitude.Resonant-Surge
- Noise.All.Entropy-Cascade
```

### Power Consistency Checklist
- [ ] Does this technique have a cost?
- [ ] Is it grounded in the Five Variables?
- [ ] Does it fit the character's Coherence Mode?
- [ ] Are Failure Mode risks acknowledged?
- [ ] Does it follow the Prime Law?
