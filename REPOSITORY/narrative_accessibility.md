# NARRATIVE ACCESSIBILITY: The Neurodivergent Reader
> **Goal**: Create a narrative experience that not only accommodates autistic processing styles but validates them as a superior way to interface with The Soundscape.

---

## 1. THE SCORE AS SOCIAL PROSTHETIC
**Challenge**: Autistic readers often struggle with unstated subtext, ambiguous social cues, and "reading between the lines."
**Solution**: The AR HUD ("The Score") makes the implicit *explicit*.

-   **Social Tagging**: Do not rely on "he looked angry." Use the HUD to tag it.
    -   *Standard*: "Voss frowned, looking displeased."
    -   *The Score*: **> TARGET: VOSS // MICRO-EXPRESSION: CONTEMPT [CONFIDENCE: 98%]**
-   **Intent Translation**: When characters use sarcasm or metaphor, the HUD can flag it.
    -   **> ANALYSIS: METAPHOR DETECTED. LITERAL INTERPRETATON SUSPENDED.**
-   **Benefit**: This allows the reader to relax. They don't have to decode the social interaction; the system does it for them, allowing them to focus on the plot/system.

## 2. SENSORY PROCESSING AS MECHANIC
**Challenge**: Sensory overload is a daily reality, often treated as a weakness in fiction.
**Solution**: Gamify sensory regulation. Overload is not a panic attack; it is **System Bandwidth Exceeded**.

-   **Damping = Masking**: The "Damping" stat is a direct metaphor for Masking (suppressing natural behaviors to fit in).
    -   *Low Damping*: "Unmasked" / High sensitivity / High power.
    -   *High Damping*: "Masked" / Low sensitivity / Safe but exhausting.
-   **The Meltdown**: Reframe a meltdown as a **Resonance Event**. It is an uncontrolled release of energy due to exceeding buffer limits. It is dangerous, but powerful.
-   **Visualizing Overstim**: Use the "Glitch/Artifacting" visual language to show when the environment is too loud/bright. The text should fragment or become repetitive to mirror the processing loop.

## 3. STIMMING IS CALIBRATION
**Challenge**: Repetitive self-stimulatory behaviors (rocking, tapping, humming) are often stigmatized.
**Solution**: In The Soundscape, "Stimming" is **Manual Phase Calibration**.

-   **Tapping**: Not nervous fidgeting. It is **Active Tempo Maintenance**.
-   **Humming**: Not annoying. It is **Internal Frequency Stabilization**.
-   **Effect**: Characters who *don't* stim (Normal people) are actually less precise. The "weird" behaviors are actually high-level technical adjustments.
    -   *Narrative Note*: "Taro tapped his thumb against his thigh in 13/8 time. To an observer, he looked anxious. In reality, he was syncing his pulse to the room's refresh rate."

## 4. INFO-DUMPING IS A SUPERPOWER
**Challenge**: "Info-dumping" (talking at length about special interests) is discouraged in standard writing advice ("Show, Don't Tell").
**Solution**: The **Deep Dive Analysis**.

-   The system rewards detailed knowledge.
-   When Taro analyzes something, allow the narrative to go "hyper-focus." The prose shifts from narrative flow to **Data Dense** mode.
-   This validates the "Special Interest" information gathering style. The hero saves the day *because* he memorized the technical manual, not because he was "brave."

## 5. CLEAR COMMUNICATION HIERARCHY
**Challenge**: Vague instructions or non-literal requests.
**Solution**: The System demands precision.

-   **Command Syntax**: Abilities work best with precise, unambiguous commands.
    -   *Bad*: "Hit him hard!"
    -   *Good*: **> EXECUTE: IMPACT_WAVE [AMPLITUDE: MAX]**
-   **Character Archetypes**:
    -   *Hana (Square Wave)*: The Autistic Coded Ideal. She speaks literal truths, dislikes ambiguity, and demands precision. She is powerful *because* of these traits, not in spite of them.
    -   *Taro (Variable Wave)*: The ADHD/Sensory Integration Coded Hero. He has too much input, struggles to filter, but has moments of hyper-focus brilliance.

## IMPLEMENTATION CHECKLIST
- [ ] **HUD Tags**: Am I tagging emotional states?
- [ ] **Literalism**: Is the magic system consistent and rule-based?
- [ ] **Sensory Data**: Am I describing *inputs* (Hz, Light, Texture) rather than just "vibes"?
- [ ] **Validation**: Is the "weird" behavior shown to be useful?

*"The world is noisy. The Score makes it data. Data can be solved."*
