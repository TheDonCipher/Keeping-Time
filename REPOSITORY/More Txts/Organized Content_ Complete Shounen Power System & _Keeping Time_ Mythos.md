## ⚖️ Part 1: The Shounen Power System Framework
A complete and balanced power system is defined by eight core pillars that ensure consistency, tension, and character-driven growth.

| Pillar | Description |
| :--- | :--- |
| **1. Clear Source** | A well-defined origin (Internal, External, or Hybrid) that obeys consistent laws. |
| **2. Hard Rules** | Measurable limits and costs combined with "soft" creative expression. |
| **3. Character Reflection** | Power mirrors the user's personality, beliefs, and psychological growth. |
| **4. Multiple Axes** | Victory depends on strategy, intelligence, and matchups, not just "bigger numbers." |
| **5. Real Costs** | Power extracts payment (physical harm, emotional erosion, or social loss). |
| **6. Training Focus** | Growth follows effort and insight rather than random "lottery" awakenings. |
| **7. World Integration** | The system reshapes society, education, and class structures. |
| **8. Counters & Ceilings** | Every power has a weakness and a limit to preserve tension. |

## ⚙️ Part 2: System Audit - "The SOUNDscape"
The framework applied to *The Signal and the Static Codex*, treating it as a battle-ready canon.

### **Core Mechanics**
- **Power Source**: Bio-Plasma localized in the **Resonance Matrix**, traced to the **Black Sun**.
- **Variables**: Coherence (Control), Amplitude (Output), Frequency Range (Versatility).
- **Failure Modes**: Frequency Burnout, Feedback Loops, and Identity Erosion.

### **Key Recommendations**
- **Resonance Ceilings**: Introduce hard caps per Sephira (e.g., Yesod cannot sustain multi-target effects).
- **Visible Costs**: Externalize consequences (auditory hallucinations, color desaturation, memory bleed).
- **Failure Loops**: Require a collapse or loss before a character can advance to a new Sephira.

## 📖 Part 3: Volume I Narrative Skeleton - "Keeping Time"
A 20-chapter production bible structured into five distinct acts.

### **Act I: The City That Keeps Time**
*Theme: Comfort, order, unnoticed control.*
- **Ch 1-4**: Establish the world where sound is infrastructure. Introduce "Calibrators" and the subtle unease of "Low-Fidelity" zones.

### **Act II: The Unnamed Variable**
*Theme: The system notices an anomaly.*
- **Ch 5-8**: Introduce the protagonist as an "outlier" who is unaffected by desynchronization. The system begins to self-protect through institutional denial.

### **Act III: Fractures**
*Theme: The system strains.*
- **Ch 9-12**: Escalate stakes as Low-Fi zones persist. Introduce forbidden terminology and the first clear resistance from the outlier.

### **Act IV: Keeping Time**
*Theme: Authority vs. Inevitability.*
- **Ch 13-16**: The system intensifies its correction efforts. A senior calibrator realizes the truth: the system is being outpaced. The outlier is officially "erased."

### **Act V: Resonance**
*Theme: Identity without permission.*
- **Ch 17-20**: The protagonist learns through sensation and breath. A Low-Fi zone stabilizes naturally. Ends on the introduction of "Control of Calibration" and lingering uncertainty.

## 🤖 Part 4: AI Generation Prompts
Sample prompts designed for consistent content generation.

- **Atmosphere**: "Write a grounded, atmospheric opening... Sound is ever-present but never dramatic... Tone: calm, observational, slightly uncanny."
- **Character**: "Portray Calibrators as engineers, technicians, civil servants... Emphasize professionalism, restraint, and procedure."
- **Conflict**: "Introduce the phrase 'Control of Calibration' without explanation. Let characters react with fear or silence."
