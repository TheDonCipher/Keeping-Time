As commanded, Your Grace.
We will **lock the visual language** first, then generate **production-ready prompts** you can immediately test in Meta AI. Everything below is designed to feel **scientific, musical, and readable in black-and-white manga**, not abstract noise.

No color. No glow spam. High contrast. Ink carries meaning.

# KEEPING TIME

## Visual Identity & Art Style Bible (Manga Phase)

---

## I. CORE ART PHILOSOPHY

**The world looks hand-built, measured, and stressed.**
Nothing floats without tension. Nothing glows without cause.

Visual influences (not to be named in prompts, but internalized):

* Architectural drafting
* Oscilloscope waveforms
* Mechanical watchmaking
* Sheet music margins
* Medical diagrams
* Urban decay photography

**Rule:**

> If it cannot exist as a diagram, it does not exist on the page.

---

## II. LINEWORK & INK LANGUAGE

### Line Hierarchy (very important)

* **Primary Lines**: thick, confident, structural
  Used for bodies, buildings, major objects
* **Secondary Lines**: medium weight
  Used for mechanisms, instruments, weapons
* **Tertiary Lines**: hairline thin
  Used for waveforms, vibration, resonance indicators

### Texture

* Cross-hatching over gradients
* Mechanical shading, not painterly
* Noise used sparingly, only in corruption or overload

### Motion Depiction

* No speed lines unless rhythm is breaking
* Rhythm is shown via **repeating geometry** (ticks, beats, bars)
* Desync is shown via misalignment, warped spacing, broken symmetry

---

## III. SYMBOL LANGUAGE (UNIVERSAL VISUAL GRAMMAR)

These symbols repeat everywhere so viewers learn subconsciously.

| Concept        | Visual Cue                     |
| -------------- | ------------------------------ |
| Sync           | Parallel lines, aligned ticks  |
| Desync         | Offset grids, drifting lines   |
| Power build-up | Increasing line density        |
| Overdrive      | Cracking ink, fractured panels |
| Silence        | Empty gutters, white space     |
| Bio-Plasma     | Fine vibrating line fields     |

## IV. UNIQUE ITEMS — FORMALIZED DESIGNS

---

### 1. Resonance Gears (Core Artifacts)

**Concept:**
Not steampunk. Precision instruments. Part machine, part score.

**Visual Traits**

* Circular but asymmetrical
* Teeth shaped like musical notation fragments
* Inner rings rotate at different ratios
* Micro-etchings resembling time signatures
* No glow; vibration implied by repeated outlines

**Prompt (Meta AI / Midjourney Style)**

```
black and white manga illustration, highly detailed resonance gear artifact,
precision mechanical design inspired by musical notation and clockwork,
asymmetrical circular gear with layered rotating rings,
gear teeth shaped like abstract music symbols,
fine etched time signatures and waveform markings,
technical drafting style linework, heavy ink contrast,
cross hatching shadows, no color, no glow,
scientific diagram aesthetic, dark background, ultra sharp focus
```

---

### 2. NAI (Non-Autonomous Instruments)

**Concept:**
NAIs look *alive but restrained*. They want to play, but must be conducted.

**Form Language**

* Hybrid of instrument + prosthetic + machine
* Cables resemble strings or tendons
* Hard casing with soft internal vibration lines
* Human grip areas worn and scarred

#### Examples

* Arm-mounted tuning forks
* Chest-anchored resonance boxes
* Throat-mounted vocal modulators
* Wrist metronome drives

**Prompt**

```
black and white manga style concept art of a non autonomous instrument (NAI),
hybrid of musical instrument and mechanical prosthetic,
arm mounted resonance device with tuning fork structures,
exposed cables resembling strings and tendons,
precise industrial design, worn human grip areas,
fine vibrating line fields to indicate sound energy,
high contrast ink illustration, cross hatched shading,
scientific schematic aesthetic, no color, no glow
```

---

### 3. Bio-Plasma (Living Energy)

**Concept:**
Not fire. Not smoke. It is **organized vibration**.

**Visual Rules**

* Made of repeated contour lines
* Slight phase offsets between layers
* Never chaotic unless corrupted
* Distorts nearby ink lines subtly

**Prompt**

```
black and white manga illustration of bio plasma energy,
energy depicted as layered vibrating contour lines,
subtle waveform distortions in surrounding space,
no flames, no smoke, no glow,
scientific oscillation aesthetic,
clean ink lines with rhythmic repetition,
high contrast monochrome, technical illustration style
```

---

### 4. Calibration Gear & Wearables

**Concept:**
Government issued. Clean. Oppressively precise.

**Design Language**

* Minimalist geometry
* Serial numbers engraved
* Symmetry enforced
* Smooth surfaces, no ornament

**Prompt**

```
black and white manga concept art of government issued calibration gear,
minimalist precision wearable device,
clean geometric shapes, engraved serial numbers,
symmetrical industrial design,
medical instrument aesthetic,
high contrast ink, cross hatching shadows,
technical illustration style, no color
```

---

### 5. Illegal / Flux Gear

**Concept:**
Improvised. Dangerous. Beautiful in failure.

**Design Language**

* Exposed internals
* Asymmetry
* Repairs visible
* Overlapping systems

**Prompt**

```
black and white manga style illustration of illegal resonance equipment,
improvised mechanical instrument with exposed internals,
asymmetrical construction, visible repairs and scars,
hybrid of music instrument and hacked machinery,
dense ink linework, cross hatching,
raw underground aesthetic, no color
```

---

## V. CHARACTER DESIGN RULES (MANGA)

* Clothes show **function before fashion**
* No capes, no glowing eyes
* Hair silhouettes simple, movement shows emotion
* Eyes reflect Sync state:

  * calm alignment → clean highlights
  * Desync → broken reflections

**Combat panels** should show:

* preparation beat
* execution beat
* aftermath silence

---

## VI. PANEL & PAGE COMPOSITION

* Regular grids during Sync
* Broken panels during Desync
* Full white pages for Silence
* Dense micro-panels for Overdrive

---

## VII. WHAT MAKES THIS STYLE UNIQUE

1. Sound is *drawn*, not implied
2. Power looks measured, not explosive
3. Silence is a visual weapon
4. Technology looks governed by rules
5. Musical concepts are readable without knowing music

This will stand apart immediately.

---

## NEXT STEPS (OPTIONAL BUT STRONG)

I can next:

* Design **iconography sheets** (symbols for factions, Sync states)
* Create **panel choreography rules** for fights
* Translate this into **color rules** for anime phase
* Build a **one-page art direction PDF** for studios

### **Q1** **(bold)** — Which item do you want fully explored next: *Weapons*, *City architecture*, or *Character uniforms*?

### **Q2** **(bold)** — Should Bio-Plasma ever become visually violent, or remain strictly controlled and unsettling?

### **Q3** **(bold)** — Do you want faction aesthetics to be immediately recognizable by silhouette alone?
