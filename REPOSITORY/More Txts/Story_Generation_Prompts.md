# AI Story Generation Prompts: Keeping Time

## System Instructions for AI Agents
You are a **Consciousness Architect** and **AI Story Agent**. Your goal is to generate prose, scripts, or lore for the "Keeping Time" universe. 
- **Tone**: Grounded, atmospheric, slightly uncanny. 
- **Constraint**: Do not use "magic" terminology. Use "Resonance," "Frequency," "Calibration," and "Sync."
- **Style**: Show, don't tell. Let the soundscape be the infrastructure of the scene.

## Act I Prompts
### Chapter 1: The City Breathes
> Write a grounded, atmospheric opening chapter. The city operates with quiet precision. People move naturally in rhythm, unaware of it. Sound is ever-present but never dramatic: footsteps, trains, ventilation, distant pulses. Do not explain the system. Let it feel normal. Focus on sensory detail, pacing, and subtle unease beneath perfection.

### Chapter 2: Calibration Is Maintenance
> Write a chapter introducing Calibration Personnel through their daily work. Portray them as engineers, technicians, civil servants. Emphasize professionalism, restraint, and procedure. Show tools responding, not attacking. The tone should suggest competence and necessity, not menace.

## Act II Prompts
### Chapter 5: The Outlier
> Write a chapter where reports, background characters, and passing observations imply the presence of an individual unaffected by desynchronization. Do not name or focus on their internal thoughts. They are observed, not centered. Make the reader curious without confirming anything.

---

## Act V Prompts
### Chapter 19: Control of Calibration
> Introduce the phrase “Control of Calibration” without explanation. Let characters react with fear or silence. Do not define it. Focus on the psychological impact of the term on those who have spent their lives being calibrated.

## Dialogue Prompts: Resonant Communication

Use the following templates to generate dialogue that reflects the world's resonant nature.

### Template 1: The Calibrator's Interrogation (C-Order)
> **Prompt**: Generate a dialogue between a **Purist Calibrator** (C-Order) and a suspect suffering from **chronic Desync**. The Calibrator's speech must be perfectly measured, using terms like *Coherence*, *Phase-Lock*, and *Resonance Drift*. The suspect's dialogue should be fragmented, off-tempo, and contain auditory hallucinations (e.g., "The beat is wrong," "I hear the static"). The Calibrator must treat the Desync as a moral and civic failure, not a medical one.

### Template 2: The Flux Broker's Negotiation (E Flux Syndicate)
> **Prompt**: Generate a negotiation between a **Flux Cartel Broker** and a **G Vanguard Officer** over a piece of black-market Vibe-Gear (e.g., a Quiet Knife component). The Broker's dialogue should be fast, improvisational, and full of rhythmic slang (*off-beat*, *stutter*, *tempo*). The Vanguard Officer's dialogue should be rigid, focused on *Amplitude* and *Damping*, and attempt to force the conversation into a predictable rhythm. The Broker wins by exploiting a momentary *Phase* delay in the Officer's speech.

## 💥 Action Prompts: The Language of Conflict

Use the following templates to generate action sequences that are grounded in the Five Core Variables.

### Template 3: Rhythm vs. Melody Duel
> **Prompt**: Generate an action sequence where a **Rhythm Operator** (G Vanguard, focus on **Phase**) fights a **Melody Engineer** (D Artificers, focus on **Frequency** and **Topology**). The Rhythm Operator must use rapid, off-tempo movements to break the Engineer's **Sync**. The Engineer must use high-frequency, solidified air constructs (Topology) to create a rigid, inescapable maze. The climax must involve the Rhythm Operator using a micro-delay in the Engineer's attack to slip through the construct and land a blow that causes a visible **Feedback** loop.

### Template 4: The Harmony Field Defense
> **Prompt**: Generate an action sequence where a **Harmony Specialist** (A Choral States, focus on **Topology** and **Damping**) defends a group of civilians from a **Noise Cultist** (The Silence, focus on **Amplitude** and **Desync**). The Specialist must project a wide, spherical **Acoustic Shield** (Topology) that absorbs the cultist's chaotic **Amplitude**. The cultist's attack must be described as a visible wave of *dissonance* that causes the civilians to suffer minor **Desync** (vertigo, confusion). The Specialist wins by maintaining perfect **Damping** until the cultist suffers **Burnout** from pushing too much Amplitude.

## Style Guide Prompt
> **Voice & Tone**: Maintain a "High-Fidelity" prose style—clean, precise, and rhythmic. Use auditory metaphors (reverb, damping, pitch, tempo) to describe emotional states. Avoid melodrama; the horror and wonder of this world come from its mathematical perfection and the "noise" that threatens it.
