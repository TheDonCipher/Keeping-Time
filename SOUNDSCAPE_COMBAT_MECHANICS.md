# THE SOUNDSCAPE: COMBAT MECHANICS & RPG GUIDE
## System Specification v1.5

This document formalizes the "Shounen Combat" logic found in the REPOSITORY into a playable or writeable system.

### 1. CORE COMBAT STATS
Unlike traditional RPGs, the Soundscape uses **Acoustic Variables**:

| Stat | Function | Gameplay Effect |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **SYNC** | Replaces HP/Stamina | Success/Accuracy. High Sync = Precise actions. Zero Sync = Defeat/Unconscious. |
| **PUSH** | Replaces Attack/MP | Output Power. High Push increases damage but drains Sync and builds Heat. |
| **CONTROL** | Replaces Defense/Res | Influence over the field. Determines terrain mastery and tactical advantage. |

### 2. THE THREE FAILURE MODES
Every high-level move carries a risk. Rolling a "Critical Fail" or over-Pushing results in:

1. **DESYNC**: Internal contradiction. Your move misfires or hits an ally. (Caused by fear or confusion).
2. **FEEDBACK**: External overload. You take damage as your own resonance turns back on you.
3. **BURNOUT**: Irreversible damage. Permanent reduction in your maximum Frequency Range (FRQ).

### 3. COMBAT STYLES (CLASSES)
- **Rhythm Fighters**: Fast, aggressive, interruptive. Focus on breaking an opponent's tempo.
- **Melody Fighters**: Tacticians. Using Control to shape the battlefield and set traps.
- **Harmony Fighters**: Support. Healing allies' Sync and buffing team coordination.
- **Noise Fighters**: Glass cannons. High Push, low Control. They break the rules of physics at high personal cost.

### 4. THE SEPHIROTIC PROGRESSION
Users don't "Level Up" by grinding. They gain **Permissions**:
1. **Apprentice (Malkuth)**: Basic NAI control.
2. **Journeyman (Yesod)**: Master of personal Bio-Plasma.
3. **Maestro (Tiphareth)**: Multi-domain integration.
4. **Conductor (Kether)**: Root access. Temporary right to edit reality's source code.
