# Publication Strategy: Keeping Time

To preserve the **"Full Web Experience"** (Residual Archive sidebar, bio-reactive UI, diegetic console logs), you cannot use traditional web novel platforms like Wattpad or Royal Road as your primary home—they strip out all custom HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

Instead, I recommend a **Hybrid 3-Tier Strategy**:

## Tier 1: The Canonical Home (Full Fidelity)
**Goal:** preserve 100% of the code and experience.

### 1. [Vercel](https://vercel.com) (Current Path)
*   **Why:** You already have a `vercel.json`. Vercel is optimized for this type of project.
*   **Best for:** The "Professional" canonical link.
*   **Action:** Deploy the `public/` folder. Use a custom domain (e.g., `keepingtime.ink` or `the-score.io`) to make it feel like a standalone artifact.

### 2. [Neocities](https://neocities.org)
*   **Why:** A spiritual successor to GeoCities, but for the modern "indie web." Its community values "the web as art" and "weird" interfaces.
*   **Best for:** Finding a niche, artistic audience who will appreciate the code-driven storytelling.
*   **Customization:** Supports full HTML/JS/CSS.

## Tier 2: Community Hubs (Discovery)
**Goal:** Get the work in front of readers who like interactive/indie fiction.

### 1. [Itch.io](https://itch.io)
*   **Why:** Not just for games! Itch is a massive hub for "Digital Zines" and "Interactive Fiction."
*   **Format:** Upload the project as a **Web Game**. It will run inside a frame on their site, preserving your Residual Archive and UI.
*   **Monetization:** Excellent "Pay what you want" model.

### 2. [Electronic Literature Collection](https://eliterature.org)
*   **Why:** If you want to position *Keeping Time* as an "Electronic Literature" (e-lit) artwork, you can submit it to organizations like the **ELO (Electronic Literature Organization)**.

## Tier 3: Marketing & Syndication (Traffic)
**Goal:** Funnel people from massive platforms back to your Tier 1 site.

### 1. [Royal Road](https://royalroad.com) / [Scribble Hub](https://scribblehub.com)
*   **The Strategy:** Release "Lite" versions of the chapters (text only).
*   **The Hook:** In the author's note, say: *"To experience the Residual Archive and the bio-reactive 'Score,' read the full version at [your-site.com]."*

### 2. [Substack](https://substack.com)
*   **The Strategy:** Use this as your "Newsletter" to notify readers of new chapters.
*   **The Hook:** Send out a preview, and link to the interactive HTML page for the full reading experience.

## Comparison Summary

| Platform | Preserves Code? | Built-in Audience? | Best Use Case |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Vercel** | ✅ 100% | ❌ No | The "Master" version of the novel. |
| **Itch.io** | ✅ 100% | ✅ Yes (Gamers/Indie) | Primary community discovery. |
| **Neocities** | ✅ 100% | ✅ Yes (Web Artists) | Artistic/Experimental credibility. |
| **Royal Road** | ❌ 0% | ✅ ✅ High (Readers) | Traffic funnel / Word of mouth. |

> [!TIP]
> **Priority #1:** Finalize the Vercel deployment. Having a stable, fast URL is the foundation for everything else.
> **Priority #2:** Create an **Itch.io** page. It's the most "frictionless" way to get found by people who enjoy experimental digital work.
