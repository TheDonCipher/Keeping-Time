# THE SCORE: UI/UX MECHANICS & VISUAL GUIDE

> **"The world is data. The Score is how we read it."**

The Score is the visual language of *Keeping Time*. It is an Augmented Reality (AR) overlay generated by the **Neural-Acoustic Interface (NAI)** that translates invisible resonance physics into readable graphic information.

## 1. VISUAL ANATOMY OF THE SCORE

The interface is not a flat screen; it is fully volumetric, depth-mapped to the physical world.

### THE STAVE (Environmental Grid)
The fundamental "ground" of the UI.
-   **Appearance**: A faint, translucent grid projected over floor/walls in a 5-line musical staff pattern.
-   **Function**: Visualizes the **Local Physics (Key Signature)**.
    -   *Flat Lines*: Neutral/Stable environment.
    -   *Undulating Lines*: Active resonance distortion.
    -   *Broken/Glitching Lines*: High interference/Noise zone.
-   **Color Coding**:
    -   **Gold**: C-Order/Standard Pitch (Permitted).
    -   **Blue**: Stable Harmonic Variance.
    -   **Red**: Dissonance/Illegal Frequency.
    -   **Static/Grey**: Dead Zone.

### THE HUD (Heads-Up Display)
Personal status indicators fixed to the user's peripheral vision.
-   **Top Left**: **BPM (Heart Rate)** & **Internal Clock Sync**.
-   **Top Right**: **Mini-Map (Radar)** showing nearby signal sources.
-   **Bottom Left**: **Output Meter** (Bio-Plasma Levels).
-   **Bottom Right**: **Damping Status** (Thermal Load on Bands).

### SIGNAL TAGS (AR Labels)
Every resonant object/person is "tagged" with a floating data window.
-   **ID**: Name / Class / Faction.
-   **Pitch**: Current output (e.g., `Standard Pitch [A4]` or `High Register`).
-   **Waveform Icon**: Visual representation of their signal (Square, Sine, Sawtooth).
-   **Intention Monitor**: Real-time analysis of their carrier wave stability.

## 2. SOCIAL INTERFACE MECHANICS

The Score acts as a **Social Prosthetic**, decoding human behavior into data.

### INTENT ANALYSIS
The system reads micro-expressions, vocal formants, and galvanic skin response to output a "Confidence Score" on the target's intent.
-   **Visual**: A text prompt appearing next to the speaker's head.
-   **Examples**:
    -   `> SPEECH_PATTERN: SARCASM [90%]`
    -   `> EMOTION: FEAR [SUPPRESSED]`
    -   `> THREAT_EVAL: POSTURING [LOW RISK]`

### GROUP SYNC (The "Party" Interface)
When users form a squad, their interfaces link.
-   **Line-of-Sight Sharing**: You see what they see.
-   **Health/Stress Bars**: Visible to all team members such as "Stress" or "Damping Load".
-   **Metronome Lock**: A shared flashing beat indicator to keep the team in tempo.

## 3. COMBAT INTERFACE MECHANICS

Combat is treated as **Signal Processing Warfare**.

### TARGETING
-   **Lock-On**: A rotating geometric reticle snaps to the target.
-   **Predictive Pathing**: The Score calculates where the sound wave *will* be, projecting a "Ghost Path" for dodging.
-   **Desync Warnings**:
    -   *Visual*: The target's tag flickers or duplicates.
    -   *Text*: `[> PHASE DRIFT DETECTED]`

### FAILURE MODE ALERTS
-   **FEEDBACK:**
    -   *Visual*: The edges of the vision turn white-hot.
    -   *Audio*: High-pitched whine increasing in pitch.
    -   *Text*: `[> AMPLITUDE CRITICAL // DUMP HEAT]`
-   **DESYNC:**
    -   *Visual*: Screen tearing, frame-rate drops, pixelation.
    -   *Audio*: Stuttering audio, dropped packets.
    -   *Text*: `[> SIGNAL LOSS // REALIGN]`
-   **BURNOUT:**
    -   *Visual*: Colors desaturate to grey. HUD elements flicker and vanish.
    -   *Audio*: Sounds become muffled/underwater.
    -   *Text*: `[> SYSTEM SHUTDOWN]`

## 4. MANUFACTURER AESTHETICS (SKINS)

The visual style of The Score depends on the user's NAI firmware and Faction.

### UNISON STOCK (C-Order Default)
-   **Font**: Sans-Serif, Clean, Swiss Design (Helvetica-ish).
-   **Colors**: Gold, White, Grey.
-   **Vibe**: Medical, Sterile, Authoritative.
-   **Features**: Heavy filters, parental controls on "dangerous" data.

### VANGUARD TACTICAL (Military)
-   **Font**: Monospace, Terminal Style.
-   **Colors**: Amber, High-Contrast Green.
-   **Vibe**: Utilitarian, cluttered with data, very fast refresh rate.
-   **Features**: Threat assessment, ballistics calculators, no social features.

### FLUX/PIRATE (Jailbroken)
-   **Font**: Pixelated, Graffiti-style, or heavily modded.
-   **Colors**: Neon Pink, Cyan, Purple.
-   **Vibe**: Glitchy, customizable, illegal overlay modules.
-   **Features**: See forbidden frequencies, dark web access, unstable frame rate.

## 5. NARRATIVE INTEGRATION EXAMPLES

**Scene: A Social Lie**
> Voss smiled warmly. "I only want to help you, Taro."
> My HUD flickered.
> **> ANALYSIS: DECEPTION**
> **> CARRIER_WAVE: JITTER [CRITICAL]**
> He was lying. The math didn't add up.

**Scene: Sensory Overload**
> The market was too loud.
> **> INPUT: PRESSURE [WARNING]**
> **> SIGNAL_SOURCES: 500+**
> **> CPU_LOAD: 99%**
> The text frames started stacking on top of each other. The tags overlapped until they were just a wall of white noise. I squeezed my eyes shut, but the AR didn't turn off. It just kept scrolling error codes against the backs of my eyelids.

**Scene: Combat Sync**
> "On my mark," Serah said.
> A countdown timer appeared in the center of my vision, synced to her heartbeat.
> **> EXECUTE IN: 3... 2... 1...**
> The world turned wireframe. Path lines illuminated in glowing green.
> **> PATH: OPTIMAL**
> I moved.
