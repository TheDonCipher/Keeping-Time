# THE SOUNDSCAPE: Factions & Political Landscape

> **"Every note has its place in the scale. Every faction codes its own UI."**

The political structure of Ouroboros is defined not just by territory, but by **Interface Permissions**.
-   **C-Order**: "Locked Garden." Safe, curating, censored.
-   **Flux**: "Open Source." Chaotic, dangerous, free.
-   **Vanguard**: "Enterise/Mil-Spec." Efficient, brutal, restricted.

---

## THE GRAND CONCORD (C-Order)

### Unison Court
**The Calibration Authority**

**UI Skin**: **"The White Room"**
-   **Visuals**: Minimalist. Gold text on transparency. No clutter.
-   **Filters**: Auto-hides chaos/poverty/dissonance. Users literally *cannot see* the bad parts of the city.
-   **Philosophy**: "If you don't see it, it isn't real."

## THE GRAND CONCORD (C-Order)

### Unison Court
**The Calibration Authority**

| Aspect | Detail |
|--------|--------|
| Symbol | Perfect Circle with central dot |
| Seat | Unison Hall, heart of the Twilight Band |

| Philosophy | Stability through calibration, order through harmony |

#### Structure
- **High Calibrators**: Supreme council of seven
- **Pitch Wardens**: Enforcers of resonance law

#### Internal Schism

**The Purists**
- Believe the Standard Pitch must never change
- Advocate for rigid calibration of all citizens
- Fear any deviation leads to Silence
- *"One frequency. One world. One song."*

**The Adaptive Moderates**
- Believe the Standard Pitch must evolve with the times
- Advocate for flexible calibration within bounds
- See rigid control as another form of death
- *"A living song changes. A dead song stays the same."*

**Current Tension**: The Purists hold majority but Moderates have public sympathy. Civil conflict brewing.

## THE FLAT DESCENT

The factions that move "downward" in the Circle, toward flatter frequencies and deeper resonance.

### Current Conflicts

1. **Purist vs Moderate** (Internal C-Order)
   - Brewing civil war within the Grand Concord

2. **E Flux vs Grand Concord**
   - Syndicate pushes boundaries, Concord pushes back

3. **B-flat Infrastructure Monopoly**
   - Other factions resent Resonant Houses' control

4. **Silence Infiltration**
   - Agents suspected in all factions

### Power Balance

## FOR AI AGENTS: Faction Usage

### Faction Voice Guides

**Grand Concord**: Formal, measured, speaks in terms of standards and calibration
- *"Your frequency deviates from acceptable parameters."*

**G Vanguard**: Military, rhythmic, speaks in commands and cadence
- *"Fall in. Match tempo. March or be marched upon."*

**D Artificers**: Technical, curious, speaks in engineering terms
- *"Fascinating harmonic structure. May I examine your resonance topology?"*

**A Choral States**: Communal, warm, speaks in plurals and collective terms
- *"We feel your discord. Join our chorus. Be whole with us."*

**E Flux**: Chaotic, energetic, speaks in fragments and tangents
- *"Standard? Boring! Push it! Break it! Remake it better!"*

**The Silence**: Whispers, pauses, speaks in negations
- *"Shhh. Listen. Hear the peace between the notes. That is truth."*

### Conflict Generator
When creating faction conflicts:
1. Identify opposing positions on the Circle
2. Determine resource/ideology clash
3. Consider Silence exploitation of conflict
4. Remember: No faction is purely good or evil

---

*"The Circle turns. The factions dance. And the Silence waits."*
