# KEEPING TIME: Master Repository Index

## Project Overview

**Keeping Time** is a shounen manga/anime series set in **The Soundscape** universe, where sound and resonance form the fundamental physics governing all reality. Power flows from Bio-Plasma fields and is controlled through the manipulation of Frequency, Phase, Amplitude, Topology, and Damping.

The story takes place on **Ouroboros**, a toroidal world orbiting a mysterious **Black Sun** at its center. In this world, the core truth is simple:

> **"If you lose the rhythm, you lose the fight."**

### Core Themes
- **Resonance over Force**: Power comes from synchronization, not raw strength
- **Clarity Under Pressure**: The true measure of ability is maintaining coherence when chaos strikes
- **Harmony and Dissonance**: The eternal tension between order and entropy

## Quick Reference Cards

### The Five Core Variables
```
FREQUENCY  - What you resonate WITH (pitch/identity)
PHASE      - WHEN you resonate (timing/sync)
AMPLITUDE  - HOW STRONG the resonance (power/intensity)
TOPOLOGY   - The SHAPE of the wave (structure/form)
DAMPING    - Rate of energy LOSS (control/endurance)
```

### The Four Domains
```
RHYTHM   (Timing)     - When to act, tempo control
MELODY   (Structure)  - How patterns form and flow
HARMONY  (Alignment)  - Multiple waves in sync
NOISE    (Entropy)    - Chaos, interference, decay
```

### The Three Failure Modes
```
DESYNC   - Phase drift, losing the beat, isolation
FEEDBACK - Amplitude runaway, destructive loops
BURNOUT  - Damping failure, exhaustion, collapse
```

### Shounen Combat Stats
```
SYNC    = Phase + Frequency alignment (connection/teamwork)
PUSH    = Amplitude + Topology output (raw power)
CONTROL = Damping + stability maintenance (endurance)
```

### The Prime Law
> **"Coherence cannot be created, only redistributed."**
> To gain clarity here, something elsewhere must fall into noise.

## World At A Glance

### Ouroboros - The Toroidal World
- **Inner Ring**: High-energy zone, close to Black Sun, intense resonance
- **Outer Ring**: Deep/memory zone, echoes of the past, slower frequencies
- **Twilight Band**: Balance zone, where most civilization exists

### The Black Sun
The central star of Ouroboros - not a source of light but of **pure resonance**. It hums at the Fundamental Frequency from which all other vibrations derive.

| Quick term lookup | 10_GLOSSARY | Relevant detailed doc |

### Consistency Rules
1. **NEVER** use the word "magic" - use Resonance, Frequency, Calibration, Sync
2. **ALWAYS** ground abilities in the Five Variables
3. **MAINTAIN** the shounen rule: "If you lose the rhythm, you lose the fight"
4. **REMEMBER** the core principle: "Power is clarity under pressure"
5. **REFERENCE** the Circle of Fifths for faction relationships

### Tone Guidelines
- **Action**: Rhythmic, percussive prose with beat-like pacing
- **Exposition**: Musical terminology woven naturally
- **Dialogue**: Characters speak in terms of sync, phase, harmony
- **Conflict**: Always frame as resonance vs. dissonance
