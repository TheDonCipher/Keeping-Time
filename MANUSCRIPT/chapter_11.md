### [TIME: UNKNOWN] THE WIRE

There was no up. There was no down.
There was only Noise.

Taro tried to scream, but "screaming" was a concept that required a medium, and the medium was gone. The air wasn't air anymore; it was a pressurized static that tasted like aluminum and dead batteries.

The world was ending. Or loading. Or both.

**> ERROR: NO_SIGNAL**

He was falling through the architecture of reality.  
Or maybe reality was falling through him.

Without the NAI to render the geometry of the alleyway, the brick walls were just meaningless data points. They didn't look like walls. They looked like jagged tears in the fabric of his perception. The ground wasn't solid; it was a vibrating field of unorganized molecular probability—an analog nightmare of raw, unindexed matter.

He hit it.  
*CRASH.*

Pain.  
Pain was real. Pain didn't need a driver.  
It exploded up his spine, a raw, analog signal that bypassed every filter he had.

**> ERROR: PAIN_RECEPTORS [OVERLOAD]**
**> ACTION: EMERGENCY_PROTOCOL**

And then—

Silence.

Not the screaming void-silence of the alley.  
A different silence. Heavy. Compressed.  
The silence of a system powering down to bare minimum.

Taro opened his eyes.

The world had stopped melting. But it was wrong. Fundamentally wrong.

He was lying on a flat, grey plane. The texture was pure wireframe. No color. No material properties. Just geometry. The walls around him were rendered in blue outline, like the schematics of a building that didn't exist yet. The sky was a flat, cyan grid stretching to infinity.

**> SAFE_MODE: ENGAGED**
**> RESOLUTION: 180p**
**> TEXTURES: DISABLED**
**> PHYSICS: BASIC**

It was [[Safe Mode::An emergency NAI protocol that renders the world in basic wireframe polygons to save processing power, stripping high-fidelity textures.]]

And it was terrifying.

Because Taro could *feel* the wrongness. Time moved differently here. Every breath took an eternity. The lag between intent and action was measured in stuttering microseconds that felt like hours. When he blinked, the world froze. When he breathed, the framerate dipped.

He tried to sit up.

His body was wireframe too. Just a skeletal mesh of glowing blue edges. His hands—his hands were just vertex points and edge loops. He looked like a blueprint. A diagram. A thing that existed only as a theoretical possibility.

"Ven?" he whispered.

His voice had no echo. It fell flat against the wireframe walls and died.

No. Wait.

There was a sound.

Beneath the silence, behind it, cutting through it like a dental drill through enamel—

**EEEEEEEEEEEEEE—**

A carrier wave. The raw, unprocessed signal of the NAI's background hum. Without the audio filters to mask it, it was piercing. Maddening. A tinnitus built by God.

Taro clapped his hands over his ears. It didn't help. The sound was internal. Neuro-acoustic feedback.

"Make it stop," he gasped. "Make it—"

A flicker. Movement in the wireframe void.

Another mesh. Orange vertices. Blocky. Heavy.

Ven.

"Taro!" Ven's voice sounded compressed.  Low bitrate. "Don't move! You're redlining! Your clock speed is—"

But Taro couldn't hear the rest. The carrier wave drowned everything out.

How long had he been in this void? Seconds? Hours? His internal sense of time was gone. Without the Grid to pace him, without the city's heartbeat to sync to, he was just… drifting. A signal without a frequency.

He looked at his hands again. The wireframe was flickering. Dropping frames. Parts of his fingers were clipping through each other, vertices merging and separating in nauseating loops.

"How do I get out?!" Taro shouted into the silence.

"You don't!" Ven's mesh moved closer. "This isn't a place, Taro! This is containment! The System locked you down to stop you from crashing the server!"

Taro stared at him. "What?"

"You're too loud!" Ven roared. "Your signal is pegged at 300%! The NAI put you in Safe Mode to protect the rest of the city from *you*!"

It wasn't a life-support system.  
It was a **Containment Protocol**.

The System didn't care if Taro survived.  
It cared that he didn't break anything else on the way out.

He tried to stand. His legs buckled. Vertices collapsed. The mesh of his left knee inverted, creating a nauseating tangle of wireframe that made no geometric sense.

**> WARNING: POLYGON_COLLAPSE**
**> RECOMMENDATION: REMAIN_STILL**

"I can't stay here," Taro whispered.

"You don't have a choice!" Ven said. "Your firmware is fried! Voss will come for you. They'll debug you. Just… hold on."

But "holding on" in Safe Mode wasn't like waiting in the real world.

Time stretched.

Every second felt like a minute. Every minute felt like an hour.

The carrier wave drilled deeper into his skull.

The wireframe world began to feel more real than flesh. More permanent than memory.

Taro closed his eyes. Or tried to. His eyelids were just edge loops now. They didn't close. They clipped.

He was trapped.

Stripped of texture. Stripped of sound. Stripped of self.

Reduced to geometry.

He felt cold. He felt flat. He felt like a sketch of a person, waiting to be erased.

And somewhere in the distance, he heard the heavy, rhythmic thrum of high-fidelity engines approaching.
