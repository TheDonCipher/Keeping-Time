### [08:00:00] THE UNCANNY VALLEY

The gates of Malkuth Academy didn't look golden anymore.

Before THE crash, Taro would have seen THE monolithic archway as a masterpiece of architectural harmony—a perfect C-Major chord solidified into matter. THE AR overlay would have painted it with shimmering accolades, history widgets, and a warm, welcoming glow that vibrated at a friendly standard pitch.

Now, he just saw THE stress fractures.

He stood at THE transit platform, his bag slung over one shoulder, staring up at THE entrance. The patch Voss had installed—THE "upgrade"—was running silent in THE background. No more frantic red warnings. No more screeching alarms telling him he was out of tune. Just a quiet, high-frequency hum that felt like tinnitus.

But THE visual data... that was different.

*Crack.*
*Hiss.*
*Pop.*

The world wasn't smooth. It was a jagged mess of conflicting frequencies.

Across THE courtyard, a group of First Years were laughing. To Taro's old eyes, they would have been a harmonious cluster of pleasant notes. Now, he saw THE jagged waveforms of their anxiety spiking through their laughter. He saw THE dissonance in their forced smiles. The girl on THE left was vibrating with a sharp insecurity that clashed violently with THE boy next to her, whose heavy arrogance was drowning out everyone else.

It wasn't just unsightly. It was loud.
It was [[Social Harmony::Auto-tuning algorithm. Phase variance suppressed to <0.05%.]] .

He tapped his temple, a phantom itch where the old collar used to be. The new limiter was internal, buried deep in his Score port's kernel. It didn't block the dissonance; it just stopped him from reacting to it. It was a mute button for his output, not his input. It was an internal noose, tightening every time he tried to run sharp.

"Cadet Taro?"

He flinched. The voice was a clean, polished sine wave. Perfect pitch.

He turned to see a Proctor droid hovering nearby. Its chassis was gleaming white, but Taro could see the micro-vibrations in its levitation drive—a wobble, a slight instability that threatened to send it crashing down if the gyro slipped even a fraction of a degree.

"Identity confirmed," the droid chimed. "Welcome back. You are late for the morning assembly."

"Medical leave," Taro said. His own voice sounded strange to him—flat, compressed. Like a sample that had been saved too many times. "My buffer was full. Had a total signal loss in the tank."

"Logged. Proceed to the Amphitheater. Major Staccato is conducting a review. Stay flat, Cadet."

Taro stiffened. Staccato.

The last time he'd seen Marcus Staccato, they had been in the simulation pod, trading blows in a high-speed duel of rhythm and violence. Staccato was a virtuoso of combat, a man who moved in perfect 16th notes.

"Understood," Taro said.

He walked past the droid. As he passed, he felt the heat radiating from its cooling vents. It was running hot. Overclocked.

*Everything is broken,* he thought. *And nobody else can see the drift.*

### [08:15:00] THE AMPHITHEATER

The Amphitheater was a bowl of sound. Five hundred cadets sat in concentric rings, their personal resonance fields humming in a low, collective drone.

Taro slipped into the back row, trying to keep his resonance footprint small. He pulled up his HUD—or tried to. The gesture was instinctual, a flick of the wrist to summon the Score.

Instead of the familiar golden stave floating in the air, a sparse, utilitarian menu flickered into view in the corner of his vision.

**[[> V2.0 DIAGNOSTICS::Optimization layer status: OPTIMAL.]]**
**[[> SIGNAL: MASKED::Public resonance footprint restricted.]]**
**[[> THREAT_LEVEL: LOW::Vocal formant analysis: NOMINAL.]]**
**SDI: 0.01 | HIQ: 0.01 | Phase Drift Coefficient: 0.00 | Score Units: 0 SU**

No melodies. No harmonics. Just raw data. Voss had stripped THE poetry out of his interface.

Down in THE center of THE pit, Major Staccato was pacing. He wasn't wearing his armor today. He was in dress uniform, THE sharp creases of his jacket cutting THE air like knives.

"Precision," Staccato barked. His voice was amplified, booming through THE acoustic space. "Is not a suggestion. It is civic hygiene. It is THE law of physics."

He stopped and pointed at a holograph projected in THE center of THE room. It showed a replay of a recent sortie—a squad of cadets moving through THE Twilight Band.

"Look at this," Staccato sneered. "Sloppy. Look at THE phase alignment."

The hologram zoomed in on a cadet firing a sonic pulse. The wave was slightly off-beat, lagging milliseconds behind THE trigger pull.

"This cadet," Staccato said, his voice dropping to a dangerous whisper, "is dead. He just doesn't know it yet. In THE field, a millisecond is THE difference between a clean kill and a feedback loop that liquifies your organs. He was running too sharp. He spiked when he should have stayed flat."

The cadets shifted uncomfortably. THE collective drone of THE room wavered, dipping into a minor key.

Taro watched THE hologram. To everyone else, it looked like a standard error. But with his new eyes, Taro saw something else.

He saw THE interference.

The air around THE cadet in THE video wasn't empty. It was thick with... something. A localized distortion field. Like static cling, but aggressive. It was pulling at THE sonic pulse, dragging it out of alignment.

It was a [[Damping Field::Unauthorized frequency suppression zone. Absorption: 45%.]] .

*It wasn't his fault,* Taro realized. *The environment was hostile.*

He leaned forward, squinting. The data Voss had given him—THE ability to see THE raw code of THE world—was overlaying THE hologram. He saw faint, purple vectors swirling around THE cadet's feet.

**[[> DETECTED: NEGATIVE_RESONANCE_SINK::External energy drain identified.]]**
**[[> SOURCE: UNKNOWN::Signal triangulation: FAILED.]]**
**SDI: 0.85 | HIQ: 0.72 | Phase Drift Coefficient: 0.14 | Score Units: 12 SU**

"Major," a voice called out.

It was Hana.

She was sitting three rows down, her posture rigid. Her ponytail was a sharp exclamation point against the white uniform.

Staccato looked up. "Cadet Chord. You have an observation?"

"The atmospheric density in that sector," Hana said. Her voice was clear, but Taro could hear the strain in it. She was vibrating with suppressed load, but her Score port was working overtime to keep her damped. "Analysis: The replay does not account for the local key signature. If the environment was anti-phase Low-Fi, then the propagation delay is within standard error margins."

"Excuses," Staccato snapped. "A true resonator compensates for the medium. You tune the world, Chord. You don't let the world tune you. Stay flat. Your logic is oscillating."

"But—"

"Stay flat, Cadet."

Hana sat. The air around her spiked with a sudden, jagged red waveform. Resentment.

Taro watched the purple vectors in the hologram again. They weren't atmospheric pressure. They were intentional. Someone—or something—had dampened that cadet's shot.

*He doesn't see it,* Taro thought. *Even Staccato. He's looking at the notes, but he's not hearing the room.*

### [12:00:00] THE MESS HALL

"You look like you've been defragged."

Ven's voice was a deep, rumbling bass that vibrated in Taro's chest.

They were in the mess hall after the assembly. The noise of the cafeteria was overwhelming for Taro—a cacophony of clattering trays and overlapping conversations that sounded like a thousand radios tuned to different static stations.

"I feel defragged," Taro muttered, poking at his nutrient block. It was grey. It tasted like grey.

Ven sat down opposite him, his massive frame taking up two seats. "Voss kept you in the tank for a week. We thought..." He hesitated. "We thought you burned out. Bricked."

"I almost did."

Hana slid into the seat next to Ven. She didn't look at Taro. She was staring at her datapad, her fingers flying across the holographic keys in a perfect 4/4 rhythm.

"You're out of sync," she said, without looking up. "Your carrier wave is drifting. I'm detecting a 15% deviation from your standard baseline. You’re humming, Nishimura."

"Hello to you too, Hana," Taro said.

"Your resting resonance," she continued, finally glancing at him. Her eyes were sharp, blue pixels of the grid reflected in her pupils. "It's oscillating. You used to hum at a solid standard pitch. Now you're... you're dropping frames. You're phasing in and out of the spectrum. Stay flat."

"It's the patch," Taro said. "New driver. I'm still... calibrating."

"It's sloppy code," she criticized. "Voss is usually hi-fi. This looks like a legacy overclock."

"It's not Voss," Taro said quietly. "It's me. My hardware... it doesn't like the new filters. I’m carrying too much load."

He looked at them. His team. Hana, the perfectionist, vibrating with the constant fear of failure. Ven, the tank, a solid wall of low-frequency endurance masking a deep, structural fatigue.

He saw it all. The cracks in their armor. The noise in their signals.

"I saw the hologram," Taro said, changing the subject. "In the assembly. The cadet who missed the shot."

"Simmons," Hana said. "He's incompetent."

"No," Taro said. "He was jammed."

Hana paused. "Jammed? The Twilight Band has interference, but—"

"Not interference," Taro said. He lowered his voice. "Sabotage. I saw a damping field. Targeted. Small scale. Just enough to throw off his timing. Someone wanted him to clip."

Ven stopped chewing. "Who would jam a cadet in a live-fire zone?"

"That's the question," Taro said. He looked around the cafeteria. The gleaming white walls, the perfect students, the illusion of order.

And underneath it all, the hissing, popping, grinding noise of a system that was eating itself alive.

"I think," Taro whispered, leaning in so close his Static Aura crackled against the table. "I think that the Silence isn't just outside the walls anymore. It's broadband now. It's inside the house."



He pushed his tray away. The grey nutrient block was untouched.

He needed to hear a human voice. A real one. Not these high-fidelity simulations of students.

He pulled up his comms menu. His fingers hesitated over the contact list.

**[[> CONTACT: NISHIMURA_YUMI [MOTHER]::Subject identity verified. Location: Sector 7.]]**
**[[> STATUS: OFFLINE [LAST_SEEN: 3_WEEKS_AGO]::Link unreachable. Timeout: 30s.]]**

He pressed call.

The line rang. Once. Twice.

Then, a click.

But it wasn't his mother.

**[[> ALERT: COMMS_INTERCEPT [ACTIVE]::Unauthorized link redirection detected.]]**
**[[> MONITOR: ADJUTANT_KRELL::Administrative surveillance active. Link priority: ROOT.]]**
**SDI: 0.99 | HIQ: 0.99 | Phase Drift Coefficient: 0.99 | Score Units: 140 SU**

A text window scrolled across his vision, overriding the call interface. The font was heavy, blocky red.

**"Compliance Check: Passed. Subject is attempting authorized contact. Note: Any deviation from Standard Pitch during this call will result in immediate audit of the recipient."**

Taro froze.

*Audit of the recipient.*

If he spiked... they would hurt her.

If he sounded "wrong note-ish"... Krell would pay her a visit.

The ringing stopped. The line connected.

"Taro?" Her voice was tinny, compressed. She was calling from the Low-Fi sector. "Is that you? I haven't heard from you in..."

Taro's throat tightened. He wanted to scream. He wanted to tell her about the Void. About the Patch. About Voss.

But the red text was still scrolling.

**[[> THREAT_LEVEL: ELEVATED::Neural variance identified. Audit probability: 82%.]]**
**[[> TARGETING: SECTOR_7_APARTMENT_4B::Proximity lock established.]]**

They had her location locked.

"I'm fine, Mom," Taro said. His voice was perfect. Smooth. Dead. "Just studying hard. The new curriculum is... it's great. Everything is great. I’m staying flat."

"Oh," she sounded relieved, but also confused. "You sound... different, honey. You sound so... grown up."

"Yeah," Taro said. A single, perfect tear rolled down his cheek. The system didn't flag it. Tears were silent. "I finally found my rhythm. I have to go. Class is starting."

"Okay. Be safe. I love—"

He cut the line.

He couldn't listen to her say it. Not while Krell was listening.

He stared at the black screen.

The collar around his neck hummed.

It wasn't just a leash. It was a noose. And it was around her neck too.


**[[> ALERT: PATTERN_MATCH::Acoustic anomaly detected in local environment.]]**
**[[> ANOMALY_DETECTED: INTERNAL::Core logic variance: HIGH.]]**
**SDI: 0.45 | HIQ: 0.12 | Phase Drift Coefficient: 0.05 | Score Units: 42 SU**

A notification blinked in his new, sparse HUD. It wasn't a warning from the school's system. It was a flag from his own customized, broken perception.

He looked across the room.

At a table near the exit, a group of senior cadets were eating. They looked normal. But to Taro's eyes, one of them—a tall girl with a cello case on her back—was flickering.

For a split second, her skin rendered as wireframe. Then blue static. Then flesh again.

She wasn't just out of tune.

She wasn't real.

"Taro?" Ven asked. "You okay? You're humming."

Taro blinked, clearing the vision. "I'm fine," he lied. "Just... calibrating. Staying flat."

He looked back at the girl. She was laughing now, a perfect, melodic sound. But Taro had seen the wireframe. He had seen the empty space underneath the texture map.

*The wrong note is inside the house.*
