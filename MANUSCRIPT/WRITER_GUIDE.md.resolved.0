## 1. THE SCORE: FORMATTING RULES
The AR Interface (The Score) is a character. It speaks in **Data**.

### Text Conventions
-   **System Messages**: Bold, All-Caps, Monospace (if possible).
    -   **> SYSTEM: ONLINE**
    -   **> ALERT: IMPEDANCE_MISMATCH**
-   **Tags**: Use braces for variable data.
    -   **> TARGET: {NAME} [{CLASS}]**
    -   **> INTENT: {EMOTION} [CONFIDENCE: {XX}%]**

### Usage Rules
1.  **Never narrate what you can tag.**
    -   *Bad*: "He looked angry."
    -   *Good*: **> MICRO-EXPRESSION: RAGE [SUPPRESSED]**
2.  **Use Error Codes for internal conflict.**
    -   When Taro is confused: **> LOGIC_ERROR // CONTRADICTION_DETECTED**
3.  **Glitch Text for horror.**
    -   When facing The Silence: **> SI_GNAL L__OSS // N_ULL**

## 2. NEURO-ACCESSIBILITY GUIDELINES
Make the internal experience external and validated.

### 1. Social Prosthetics
-   Autistic readers often struggle to read subtext. **The Score does it for them.**
-   Explicitly label Sarcasm, Deception, and Threat.
-   This validates the need for "Direct Communication" by making the System the ultimate direct communicator.

### 2. Gamified Sensory Processing
-   **Stimming = Calibration**. Describe tapping/rocking as "Syncing internal clock."
-   **Masking = Damping**. Describe the fatigue of social interaction as "Thermal Load" or "CPU Drain."
-   **Overload = Bandwidth**. Panic attacks are network crashes. Visuals pixelate, audio buffers.

### 3. The "Square Wave" Ideal
-   Hana Chord is the "Autistic Hero." She isn't "robotic" (negative); she is "High Fidelity" (positive).
-   Her precision saves the day. Her literalism cuts through Voss's manipulation.

## 3. MANGA/ANIME VISUALIZATION
Write prose that translates directly to panels.

### Panel Direction (SFX)
-   **Sound Effects**: Write sounds as physical impacts.
    -   *THOOM.* (Bass Drop)
    -   *ZZZTT.* (High Freq Arc)
    -   *PING.* (Notification)
-   **Camera Angles**:
    -   *HUD View*: First-person perspective with UI overlay.
    -   *Profile Scan*: Side view with "Wireframe" schematics of gear.
    -   *Speed Lines*: Use "Motion Blur" descriptions for fast action.

### Visual Metaphors
-   **The Glitch**: Use digital corruption metaphors for injury. (Pixelation instead of blood).
-   **The Aura**: Bio-plasma must look like **Waveforms** (Jagged, Smooth, Square), not generic "DBZ Aura."

## 4. CHAPTER TEMPLATE
Every chapter must start with a **System Header**:

```markdown
**ZONE: {LOCATION_NAME}**
**FIDELITY: {HI_FI / LO_FI}**
**STATUS: {ACTIVE / CONNECTED / DANGER}**
```

Every chapter must end with a **Track Complete** signal:

```markdown
**> TRACK: {CHAPTER_NUM}_COMPLETE**
**> SAVING...**
```
