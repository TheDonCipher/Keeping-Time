### [02:00:00] THE WHITE ROOM

Taro woke up in the White Room. He was in Unison Hall’s recovery ward, a secure containment sector buried deep in the root of the grid. His system was in safe mode, operational protocols throttled to a mere five percent. A level-five damping field was active, suppressing every signal until the noise floor dropped to a crushing -140dB.

Technically, it was a [[Sensory Deprivation Chamber::A blank canvas forced over the senses, absorbing every sound and sight until you are nothing but a ghost in a white void.]] , but the street name was the White Room. The walls were lined with acoustic foam so dense it absorbed 99.9% of all reflected sound. The visual feed was overridden by a "Privacy Mask"—a generated infinite void of white pixels designed to lower the user's cognitive load. We are all just pixels in a screen we didn't buy, and the White Room is the ultimate erasure—a reminder that without the Score's light, we are nothing.

It was a hard reset for the brain. A blank canvas forced over the senses. In the schools, they taught you to breathe through the silence, to find your center when the world went dark. They called it "civic hygiene." I called it being buried before you were dead.

Taro tried to move his head. A heavy mechanical resistance stopped him—a damping collar, locked and engaged with a steady 4.2V charge. It was functioning at total resonance suppression, its active damping loop holding his baseline at a flat zero.

The collar hummed against his neck. It wasn't just a restraint; it was a circuit breaker. It actively monitored his biometrics, looking for the tell-tale spike of an Upper Octave oscillation. If it found one, it grounded the signal before it could reach his hands. In the Grand Concord, to stay flat is to be safe. To spike is to be a threat. Being off-tone was a social death sentence.

For the first time in years, Taro was "Flat." It felt like being buried alive.

"Diagnostic complete," a voice said.

The infinite white void flickered. The privacy mask didn't dissolve creatively; it simply terminated. <em>END_PROCESS: PRIVACY_MASK.</em>

The room rendered in. A desk. A chair. A man.

Adjutant Voss.

Voss looked less like a human and more like a high-end peripheral. His suit was a matte-gray, frictionless material standard for [[C-Order::The ruling order of the city, a cold and absolute collective that demands every soul stay perfectly in tune or face deletion.]] administration. He sat perfectly still, his hands folded on the desk, radiating an aura of absolute stability. The Score likes stability. It likes predictability. It likes things that don't make it work too hard.

My target analysis flickered to life, mapping his acoustic profile. He was a Class-8 Adjutant, verified and absolute, his aura showing zero variance. Volatility was null.

"Hello, Taro," Voss said. His voice was calibrated. Perfectly pitched to the room's acoustics. No echo. No waste. It was the auditory equivalent of sans-serif font.

"Where am I?" Taro asked. His voice was flat, the collar swallowing the resonance of his vocal cords.

"You are in Recovery," Voss said. "We had to initiate a forced reboot. You suffered a catastrophic buffer overflow on the floor. Do you recall the incident?"

Taro closed his eyes. The memory wasn't a blur; it was a corrupt file. Jagged edges. Purple static.

"The soldier," Taro whispered. "He was desyncing."

"He was experiencing a cascade failure," Voss corrected, his tone cool and clinical. "His bio-plasma field had destabilized beyond the 5% tolerance threshold. You, however... you were running high, Taro. Extremely high. You spiked so hard the room couldn't register anything else."

Voss tapped the desk. A holographic window snapped into existence between them. It displayed a 3D wireframe of the soldier—or what was left of him.

"You executed an unauthorized overwrite," Voss said. "You didn't patch his signal. You deleted the carrier wave entirely. You bricked a Class-4 Vanguard unit in three frames. You were clipping the entire sector."

The wireframe on the screen rotated. It showed the soldier's nervous system. It was dark. Dormant. Total signal loss.

"He is functionally dead to the Soundscape," Voss explained. "A bricked unit. No sync possible."

Taro looked at his hands. He felt the phantom vibration of the High Register—the urge to fix, to tune, to change.

"He was going to crash the server," Taro said. "I balanced the equation."

"You balanced it with a sledgehammer," Voss noted. "The Grand Concord relies on precision, Taro. Not brute force. We are a high-fidelity society. Your tone was sharp. Socially embarrassing."

Voss stood up. He walked around the desk, his movement efficient, conserving kinetic energy. Every step was a calibrated vector.

"The Manual states: 'Coherence is Safety'. A shared reference signal keeps the reality rendering engine stable. You..." Voss pointed a manicured finger at Taro's chest. "You’re off-tone. You are broadcasting across the entire capacity of Sector 7. You need to stay flat."

My HUD flared with alerts. <em>SIGNAL_INSTABILITY_DETECTED.</em> A sustained drift was identified in my own signal, the stability index dropping as the load hit 142 SU.

The collar tightened. Just a millimeter. A physical reminder of the rules.

"We have two administrative options," Voss said, holding up two fingers.

**OPTION A: REFORMAT**
**> PROCEDURE:** Neural dampening.
**> OUTCOME:** Subject becomes a standard Listener (Class 1).
**> STATUS:** APPROVED.

"We scrub the noise," Voss interpreted. "We install a permanent limiter. You live a quiet, happy life. You never hear the hum again. You stay flat forever."

Taro stared at the text floating in the air. [[Reformat::The ultimate social hygiene—a clean and absolute deletion of the soul's ability to hear its own song.]]. It was systems-speak for a lobotomy.

**OPTION B: INTEGRATION**
**> PROCEDURE:** Transfer to Malkuth Academy.
**> OUTCOME:** Vanguard Certification.
**> STATUS:** HIGH_RISK.

"We utilize the noise," Voss said. "The Vanguard creates Siege Breakers. Units capable of generating high-amplitude dissonance for combat purposes. We take your wrong note... and we weaponize it. We teach you to carrying load for the state."

Voss leaned in. For a moment, the perfect, manual-compliant facade cracked. The green dissonance in his eye flickered—a single frame of unauthorized code.

"You are dangerous, Taro," Voss whispered. "But the Score needs danger. It needs heavy artillery."

Taro looked at the options.
Option A was deletion.
Option B was compilation.

"I'm not a soldier," Taro said. "I'm a calibrator. I... I fix things. My hardware is built for alignment, not for combat."

"The Vanguard fixes the enemies of the state," Voss said. "Same mechanic. Different application. We take your sawtooth oscillation and we make it tactical. We teach you to carry that load without clipping the grid."

Voss swiped his hand. **OPTION A** dissolved into code.

*COMMAND: EXECUTE_TRANSFER.* An administrative override was executed, my destination locked to Malkuth Academy—a high-fidelity resonance training facility.

"The transport leaves at 0800," Voss said, straightening his suit. "Read the manual, Taro. Learn the rules. Because if you break them again..."

He tapped the collar.

"...we will simply turn you off."

<em>SESSION: TERMINATED.</em> Secure link closed, the recording archived for the C-Order's silent audit.

The lights cut out.
