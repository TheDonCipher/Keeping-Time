### [02:00:00] THE WHITE ROOM

Taro woke up in the White Room.

Technically, it was a **Sensory Deprivation Chamber (Class A)**, but the street name was the White Room. The walls were lined with acoustic foam so dense it absorbed 99.9% of all reflected sound. The visual feed was overridden by a "Privacy Mask"—a generated infinite void of white pixels designed to lower the user's cognitive load.

It was a hard reset for the brain.

Taro tried to move his head. A heavy mechanical resistance stopped him.

**> DETECTED: DAMPING_COLLAR [LOCKED]**
**> FUNCTION: RESONANCE_SUPPRESSION**

The collar hummed against his neck. It wasn't just a restraint; it was a circuit breaker. It actively monitored his biometrics, looking for the tell-tale spike of an 880 Hz oscillation. If it found one, it grounded the signal before it could reach his hands.

For the first time in years, Taro was "Quiet."

"Diagnostic complete," a voice said.

The infinite white void flickered. The privacy mask didn't dissolve creatively; it simply terminated.

**> END_PROCESS: PRIVACY_MASK**

The room rendered in. A desk. A chair. A man.

Adjutant Voss.

Voss looked less like a human and more like a high-end peripheral. His suit was a matte-gray, frictionless material standard for C-Order administration. He sat perfectly still, his hands folded on the desk, radiating an aura of absolute stability.

**> TARGET_ANALYSIS:**
**> CLASS: ADJUTANT**
**> STABILITY: 100%**
**> THREAT: ZERO_VARIANCE**

"Hello, Taro," Voss said. His voice was calibrated. Perfectly pitched to the room's acoustics. No echo. No waste.

"Where am I?" Taro asked. His voice was flat, the collar swallowing the resonance of his vocal cords.

"You are in Recovery," Voss said. "We had to initiate a forced reboot. You suffered a catastrophic buffer overflow on the floor. Do you recall the incident?"

Taro closed his eyes. The memory wasn't a blur; it was a corrupt file. Jagged edges. Purple static.

"The soldier," Taro whispered. "He was desyncing."

"He was experiencing a **Cascade Failure**," Voss corrected, using the technical term. "His Bio-Plasma field had destabilized beyond the 5% tolerance threshold."

Voss tapped the desk. A holographic window snapped into existence between them. It displayed a 3D wireframe of the soldier—or what was left of him.

"You executed an unauthorized overwrite," Voss said. "You didn't patch his signal. You deleted the carrier wave entirely. You bricked a Class-4 Vanguard unit in three frames."

The wireframe on the screen rotated. It showed the soldier's nervous system. It was dark. Dormant. Total signal loss.

"He is functionally dead to the Soundscape," Voss explained. "A bricked unit. No handshake possible."

Taro looked at his hands. He felt the phantom vibration of the 880 Hz—the urge to fix, to tune, to change.

"He was going to crash the server," Taro said. "I balanced the equation."

"You balanced it with a sledgehammer," Voss noted. "The Grand Concord relies on **Precision**, Taro. Not brute force. We are a high-fidelity society. Your output was... noisy."

Voss stood up. He walked around the desk, his movement efficient, conserving kinetic energy. Every step was a calibrated vector.

"The Manual states: 'Coherence is Safety'. A shared reference signal keeps the reality rendering engine stable. You..." Voss pointed a manicured finger at Taro's chest. "You are running a variable frequency. You are 'Noise'. You are broadcasting across the entire bandwidth of Sector 7."

**> ALERT: SIGNAL_INSTABILITY_DETECTED**
**> SOURCE: SUBJECT_TARO**

The collar tightened. Just a millimeter. A physical reminder of the rules.

"We have two administrative options," Voss said, holding up two fingers.

**OPTION A: REFORMAT**
**> PROCEDURE:** Neural dampening.
**> OUTCOME:** Subject becomes a standard Listener (Class 1).
**> STATUS:** APPROVED.

"We scrub the noise," Voss interpreted. "We install a permanent limiter. You live a quiet, happy life. You never hear the hum again."

Taro stared at the text floating in the air. Reformat. It was systems-speak for a lobotomy.

**OPTION B: INTEGRATION**
**> PROCEDURE:** Transfer to Malkuth Academy.
**> OUTCOME:** Vanguard Certification.
**> STATUS:** HIGH_RISK.

"We utilize the noise," Voss said. "The Vanguard creates **Siege Breakers**. Units capable of generating high-amplitude dissonance for combat purposes. We take your glitch... and we weaponize it."

Voss leaned in. For a moment, the perfect, manual-compliant facade cracked. The green glitch in his eye flickered—a single frame of unauthorized code.

"You are dangerous, Taro," Voss whispered. "But the System needs danger. It needs heavy artillery."

Taro looked at the options.
Option A was deletion.
Option B was compilation.

"I'm not a soldier," Taro said. "I'm a calibrator. I... I fix things. My hardware is built for alignment, not for combat."

"The Vanguard fixes the enemies of the state," Voss said. "Same mechanic. Different application. We take your jitter and we make it tactical."

Voss swiped his hand. **OPTION A** dissolved into code.

**> COMMAND: EXECUTE_TRANSFER**
**> DESTINATION: MALKUTH_ACADEMY**

"The transport leaves at 0800," Voss said, straightening his suit. "Read the manual, Taro. Learn the rules. Because if you break them again..."

He tapped the collar.

"...we will simply turn you off."

**> SESSION: TERMINATED**

The lights cut out.
