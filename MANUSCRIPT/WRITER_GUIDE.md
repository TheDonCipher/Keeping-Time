# WRITER'S GUIDE: THE SYNESTHESIA MANUSCRIPT (FINAL)

> **Narrative Voice**: **Third Person Limited (Taro)** from Chapter 2 onwards.
> **Magic Tone**: **The User Manual**. Magic is Engineering. Use technical, precise language.
> **Visuals**: Hallucinogenic Reality (The System rewrites the world).
> **Character & Voice**: **[03_CHARACTERS_REGISTRY.md](file:///c:/Users/Japan/OneDrive/Documents/Books/Keeping%20Time/REPOSITORY/03_CHARACTERS_REGISTRY.md)** and **[VOICE_GUIDE.md](file:///c:/Users/Japan/OneDrive/Documents/Books/Keeping%20Time/REPOSITORY/VOICE_GUIDE.md)** are the mandatory style guides for dialogue and personality.

## 1. THE PHYSICS (READS LIKE A MANUAL)
The magic system is not "mystical." It is an operating system with strict rules. **Explain the rules ONLY when necessary for the plot.**

> **CRITICAL RULE**: NO LORE DUMPS IN NARRATIVE.
> If you need to explain a concept (e.g., "The Score", "Handshakes"), use the **Collapsible Sidebar** format.
> **Reference**: [SIDEBAR_LIBRARY.md](file:///c:/Users/Japan/OneDrive/Documents/Books/Keeping%20Time/REPOSITORY/SIDEBAR_LIBRARY.md)


-   **System Text**: Must be TECHNICAL and PRECISE.
    -   *Good*: **> ERROR: BUFFER_OVERFLOW [Type: Fatal]**
    -   *Good*: **> STATUS: DAMPING_FIELD [ACTIVE]**
    -   *Bad*: **> SENSATION: PAIN** (Too soft).
-   **Prose Descriptions**: Describe magic acts as engineering processes.
    -   *Example*: "The air didn't just get heavy; the local gravity coefficient shifted to 1.5g."
    -   *Example*: "Voss didn't cast a spell. He executed a root-level command that overwrote the silence."

---

## 2. NARRATIVE VOICE (THIRD PERSON)
We observe Taro, but we see the data he sees.

-   **The Approach**: Atmospheric Observer.
-   "Taro watched the display..." -> "The data scrolled across Taro's vision, a cascade of red error flags indicating catastrophic failure."

---

## 3. SENSORY FUNCTIONALISM (DE-JARGONING)
The user requested "Reduced Frequency Talk." 
**Solution**: Focus on the **Sensory Effect** and **Functional Outcome**, not the raw data.

-   **Hz vs. Name**: Strip raw frequency numbers (440Hz, 880Hz) unless they are absolutely critical to a technical plot point.
    -   *Old*: "He hit him with a 440Hz blast."
    -   *New*: "He deployed a Standard Calibration Pulse, intended to force a system reset."
-   **Numbers vs. Pitch**: Use musical names or descriptive "Zones" instead of numbers.
    -   *Gold Standard*: "A-440", "Middle C", "The Ground Note".
    -   *Zones*: "The Low-End", "The Sub-Bass", "High-Fidelity", "The Upper Register".
-   **Networking vs. Experience**: Replace digital networking terms with mechanical or sensory metaphors.
    -   *Instead of "Bandwidth"*: Use "Capacity", "Flow", "Breadth".
    -   *Instead of "Handshake"*: Use "Sync", "Lock", "Contact".
    -   *Instead of "Buffer/Latency"*: Use "Drift", "Lag", "Hitch".
    -   *Instead of "Ping"*: Use "Pulse", "Call".

## 4. FORMATTING RULES
1.  **System Headers**: Use them to define the scene's "Operating Parameters."
2.  **Visual Metaphors**: Use UI/UX metaphors. Glitches, Frame Drops, Rendering Errors, Blue Screens.
4.  **The Manual**: Occasionally, the narrative should sound like it is quoting the *Keepers' Handbook*.
5.  **Resonant Dialect**: Consult `VOICE_GUIDE.md` for slang (e.g., *Broadband*, *Damping*, *Hi-Fi*) and `03_CHARACTERS_REGISTRY.md` for character-specific system overlays.

---

*"The world is code. We are the architects."*

---

## 5. THE SIDEBAR SYSTEM (NEW)
**Objective**: Enable deep world-building without stalling the plot.

### Rule:
-   **Main Text**: Sensory, emotional, descriptive, experiential.
-   **Sidebar**: Analytical, logical, speculative, technical.

### Implementation:
Use HTML `<details>` tags for all sidebars.
```html
<aside>
<details>
<summary><strong>SUBJECT: Term Name</strong></summary>
<blockquote>
<strong>Observation:</strong> Brief empirical definition.
<br><br>
<strong>- Source: In-World Text</strong>
</blockquote>
</details>
</aside>
```

## 6. WORLD-BUILDING: THE REALITY (CHAOS VS. STRUCTURE)

-   **The System (NAI)**: Is not a lie; it is a shield. It tunes raw energy into "Music/Order."
-   **The Real World (No System)**: Is not "ugly grey buildings"; it is **Raw Chaos / Noise**. An unintelligible abyss of un-tuned resonance.
-   **The Reveal**: When the System fails, we don't see the "truth" (a slum); we see the **Void** (terrifying, non-Euclidean static).

*"Coherence is Safety. Silence is Death. Noise is Madness."*

---

## 7. PHASE 5 UPDATE: DISSONANCE VISION (POST-PATCH)
**The Shift**: After "Project Dissonance" is installed (Chapter 13), Taro sees the Source Code.
-   **Old Vision**: Musical, Immersive, Sensory.
-   **New Vision**: Structural, Mathematical, Predatory.
-   **Key Visuals**:
    -   **Stress Lines**: Glowing fractures in objects/people where they are weakest.
    -   **Raw Integers**: Seeing the potential energy values (e.g., *Potential: 50,000J*) instead of just "bright light."
    -   **Biological overlay**: Seeing organs/nervous systems as schematic diagrams.
-   **Sensation**: Cold, Invasive, "Dirty" (seeing too much information).

## 7.1 LORE EXPANSION: RESONANCE DYSPHORIA (THE WIREFRAME)
**Concept**: Some individuals have an "Inner Resonance" (True Self) that conflicts with their "Assigned Resonance" (System-enforced Hull/Appearance).
-   **The Glitch**: The System tries to "Error Correct" them into their assigned shape.
-   **The Wireframe**: When "Masking" fails (or when viewed by Dissonance Vision), the texture map glitches, revealing the raw wireframe of the "True Self" pushing against the mesh.
-   **The Illegal Mod**: "Retuning" or "Modulation" is the act of changing one's base frequency to match the inner self. The C-Order views this as "Hacktivism" or "Data Corruption."

## 8. VISUAL PROMPTS (ART STYLE GUIDE)

### SAFE MODE / BIOS
> **Keywords**: `Wireframe`, `Low-Poly`, `Blueprint Aesthetic`, `Cyanotype`, `Retro-Computing`, `Flat Shading`, `Grid infinity`.
> **Description**: The world is stripped of "textures." It looks like a debug view in a game engine.
> -   **Characters**: Faceless low-poly meshes.
> -   **Environment**: Wireframe grids over greyboxing.
> -   **Sky**: Replaced by static or solid error color (Blue/Black).
