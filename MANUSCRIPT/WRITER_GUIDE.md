# WRITER'S GUIDE: THE SYNESTHESIA MANUSCRIPT (REVISED)

> **Narrative Voice**: **Third Person Limited (Taro)**. Focus on intelligence, sensory immersion, and the blur between biology and code.
> **Linguistic Hierarchy**:
> 1. **Character Dialogue**: Natural, slang-driven, lived-in.
> 2. **Prose (Integration)**: Sensory and diagnostic data woven directly into the narrative (e.g., describing the "feeling" of a frequency or the visual texture of an AR overlay).
> 3. **HUD Notifications**: Internal system messages rendered in *italics* within the prose.
> 4. **Formal System Blocks**: Reserved only for high-impact critical events (crashes, reboots, major reveals). Format: `[[> HEADER: MSG]]`.
> 5. **Tooltips**: Narrative context, hindsight, or character-driven insights rather than raw technical stats. Format: `[[Term::Description]]`.

## 1. THE DIALOGUE (SOCIAL SLANG)
Characters do not speak like textbooks. They use musical and signal metaphors as everyday slang.

- **Approved Slang**:
    - "You’re running high." (Emotional or power spike)
    - "You’re off-tone." (Suspicious, wrong, or deceptive)
    - "Stay flat." (Calm down or mask your signal)
    - "Don’t spike." (Don't lose control)
    - "You’re clipping." (Pushing past limits or losing composure)
    - "You’re humming." (Nervous energy or micro-vibration)
    - "That’s too sharp." (Aggressive or mean-spirited)
    - "You’re carrying load." (Stressed, burdened, or fatigued)
- **Constraints**:
    - No casual dialogue should mention "Hz" values or specific technical indices.
    - Use "Wrong Note" instead of "Glitch."

## 2. THE PROSE (SENSORY INTEGRATION)
Instead of separate technical headers, weave diagnostic data into Taro's sensory experience.

- **Technical Immersion**: Describe the "latency" in a room's atmosphere or the "pixel pitch" of a beautiful sky.
- **HUD Italics**: Use *italics* for quick system updates that appear in Taro's vision.
    - *Example*: The room felt heavy, the air thick with analog interference. *SIGNAL INTEGRITY: 15% [CRITICAL].* 
- **Philosophical Tone**: Reflect on reality as a shared composition and identity as a frequency struggle.

## 3. THE TOOLTIP SYSTEM (NARRATIVE CONTEXT)
Tooltips are no longer for cold technical data. They provide context, hindsight, and emotional depth.

- **Format**: `[[Term::Description]]`
- **Example**: `[[Fundamental::A rare class of resonator who acts as a living anchor for reality, forcing a cold and absolute order upon the world's natural chaos.]]`

---

## 4. CULTURAL INTEGRATION
Resonance awareness is a social burden. 
- **Tone Control**: Taught in schools as "civic hygiene."
- **Social Shame**: Being "off-tone" in public is embarrassing or suspicious.
- **Damping**: Parents tell children to "stay level."
- **Rebellion**: Rebels intentionally "run sharp" or "spike" to signal defiance.

## 5. FORMAL SYSTEM BLOCKS (CRITICAL ONLY)
Reserve the formal `[[> HEADER: MSG]]` format for moments of high narrative impact.

```text
[[> KERNEL_PANIC: REALITY_NOT_FOUND]]
[[> STATUS: UNMASKED]]
```

---

## 6. THE SIDEBAR SYSTEM
Use HTML `<details>` tags for all sidebars to provide deep world-building without stalling the plot.

```html
<aside>
<details>
<summary><strong>SUBJECT: Term Name</strong></summary>
<blockquote>
<strong>Observation:</strong> Brief narrative or technical definition.
<br><br>
<strong>- Source: In-World Text</strong>
</blockquote>
</details>
</aside>
```

*"The world is code. We are the architects."*
