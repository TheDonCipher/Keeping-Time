# WRITER'S GUIDE: THE SYNESTHESIA MANUSCRIPT (REVISED)

> **Narrative Voice**: **Third Person Limited (Taro)**. Focus on intelligence and restraint.
> **Linguistic Hierarchy**:
> 1. **Character Dialogue**: Natural, slang-driven, lived-in.
> 2. **Narration**: Philosophical, restrained, lightly technical.
> 3. **Tooltips / System Logs**: Cold, clinical, precise technical data.

## 1. THE DIALOGUE (SOCIAL SLANG)
Characters do not speak like textbooks. They use musical and signal metaphors as everyday slang.

- **Approved Slang**:
    - "You’re running high." (Emotional or power spike)
    - "You’re off-tone." (Suspicious, wrong, or deceptive)
    - "Stay flat." (Calm down or mask your signal)
    - "Don’t spike." (Don't lose control)
    - "You’re clipping." (Pushing past limits or losing composure)
    - "You’re humming." (Nervous energy or micro-vibration)
    - "That’s too sharp." (Aggressive or mean-spirited)
    - "You’re carrying load." (Stressed, burdened, or fatigued)
- **Constraints**:
    - No casual dialogue should mention "Hz" values, "Fourier decomposition," or "harmonic instability."
    - No character explains physics unless they are explicitly C-Order trained or in a technical audit.
    - Use "Wrong Note" instead of "Glitch."

## 2. THE NARRATOR (PHILOSOPHICAL OBSERVER)
The narrator speaks with controlled intelligence, bridging the gap between raw data and human experience.

- **Technical Tone**: Use terms like *Baseline*, *Drift*, *Load*, *Resonance*, *Phase*, *Interference*, and *Structural Strain* to add gravity.
- **Philosophical Tone**: Reflect on reality as a shared composition and identity as a frequency struggle.
- **Example Transformation**:
    - *Old*: "His emotional frequency deviated sharply above baseline."
    - *New*: "His tone lifted. Higher than baseline. The room would register the drift."

## 3. THE SYSTEM LAYER (TOOLTIPS)
Tooltips are the *only* place where full technical language appears. They are cold, clinical, and precise.

- **Content**: 
    - Exact Hertz (Hz) deviations
    - Score Unit (SU) calculations
    - Spectral Deviation Index (SDI)
    - Phase Drift Coefficient
- **Example**: 
    - `Baseline: 64 Hz | Current Frequency: 78 Hz | Sustained Drift: 14 Hz | Score Accumulation: 14 SU`

## 4. CULTURAL INTEGRATION
Resonance awareness is a social burden. 
- **Tone Control**: Taught in schools as "civic hygiene."
- **Social Shame**: Being "off-tone" in public is embarrassing or suspicious.
- **Damping**: Parents tell children to "stay level."
- **Rebellion**: Rebels intentionally "run sharp" or "spike" to signal defiance against the C-Order.

---

## 5. EMOTIONAL & SURVEILLANCE SCALING
- **High Emotion**: Dialogue becomes shorter and slang-heavy. Narrator becomes quieter. Technical density drops.
- **High Surveillance**: Narrator becomes more analytical. Tooltips become more frequent. Dialogue tightens into clinical precision.

## 6. THE SIDEBAR SYSTEM
Use HTML `<details>` tags for all sidebars to provide deep world-building without stalling the plot.

```html
