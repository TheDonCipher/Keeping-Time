### [09:15:00] THE HANDSHAKE

"Initialize," Hana commanded.

They stood in a triangle. Taro, Hana, and the large student known as Ven.
The Sandbox was a void. A "Null State" environment where the Academy server suspended standard physics textures to save processing power. No walls. No floor. Just a glowing wireframe grid projected beneath their boots.

**> TEAM_LINK: PENDING**
**> NODE 1: HANA [ROOT]**
**> NODE 2: VEN [SINK]**
**> NODE 3: TARO [VARIABLE]**

"Target is a simple C-Major Triad," Hana said. "I am the reference. Ven is the bass. Nishimura, you are the Fifth."

"The Fifth?" Taro asked.

"Do not speak," Hana corrected. "Output."

A blue wireframe line shot out from Hana's chest interface. It plugged directly into Ven's aura.
*Snap.*

**> CONNECTION: ESTABLISHED**
**> LATENCY: 0ms**

It was a perfect handshake. A solid beam of blue light connecting them. They weren't reacting to each other; they were executing a pre-compiled script.

"Nishimura," Hana said. "Connect."

Taro took a breath.
He located the variable oscillation in his chest. The 880 Hz. He tried to push it out through his port.

**> OUTPUT: 20%**

A jagged, yellow lightning bolt arced from Taro toward Hana.
It hit her blue firewall shield and... bounced off.

*CRACK.*

**> ERROR: PHASE_MISMATCH**
**> TARGET_PHASE: 0**
**> INCOMING_PHASE: 90**

"You are late," Hana said. "You are pushing on the off-beat."

"I'm trying to find the pocket!"

"There is no pocket," she stated. "There is the Grid. Align yourself to the Grid."

Taro gritted his teeth.
He tried again. This time, he forced the signal. He pushed the amplitude.

**> OUTPUT: 60%**

The yellow arc slammed into her shield again.
*ZZZTT.*

Hana winced. A red error flag appeared over her head.
**> WARNING: FEEDBACK_LOOP**
**> INTEGRITY: 95%**

"You are clipping," she snapped. "Lower your amplitude. You are screaming at the server."

"I can't!" Taro shouted. "It's all or nothing! I don't have a volume potentiometer!"

"Everyone has a volume knob. It is called Damping."

"I don't!"

Taro's frustrated signal spiked.
**> OUTPUT: 95% [CRITICAL]**

The yellow lightning turned white. It lashed out wildly, missing Hana entirely and whipping toward the third node.
Ven.

Ven didn't move. He didn't block. He just... stood there.
Ven was a **Sink**. His waveform was a massive, low-frequency rolling hill. High capacity. Low impedance.

Taro's jagged 880 Hz bolt hit him.

And Ven ate it.

*THOOM.*

The impact didn't crack. It resonated.
The entire wireframe grid of the Sandbox rippled. A massive, subsonic pulse wave expanded from Ven, blowing Hana's hair back.

**> INTERFERENCE: CONSTRUCTIVE**
**> FREQUENCY_SHIFT: OCTAVE_DROP**

Taro's high-pitch nervous energy didn't bounce off Ven. It sank into his gravity well and was converted.
It came out as **Pure Bass**.

Ven looked up. His eyes—usually half-closed—were wide open. The pupils were vibrating.

**> NODE_STATUS: VEN [CHARGED]**
**> CAPACITY: 200%**

"Whoa," Ven said. His voice rumbled in Taro's chest.

Hana stared at the telemetry stream.
**> TOTAL_OUTPUT: 140dB [LETHAL]**

"That wasn't a Triad," Hana said, her voice sounding shaken. "That was a Drop."

"I didn't mean to—"

"Do it again," Ven said.
He was smiling. A quiet, sleepy smile.
"I've never been full before."

Hana looked at the data. She looked at Taro. Then at Ven.
The "Disgust" tag didn't appear.
Instead, the system calculated a new probability.

**> ANALYSIS: NEW_TOPOLOGY**
**> POTENTIAL: SIEGE_BREAKER**

"Fine," Hana said. "Forget the Triad. Let's see how much bass we can generate before the server crashes."

Taro grinned.
His system status finally flashed green.

**> SYNC: LOCKED.**
