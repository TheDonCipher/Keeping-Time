### [09:15:00] THE HANDSHAKE

"Initialize," Hana commanded.

They stood in a triangle. Taro, Hana, and the large student known as Ven.

The Sandbox was a void. A "Null State" environment where the Academy server suspended standard physics textures to save processing power. No walls. No floor. Just a glowing wireframe grid projected beneath their boots. It smelled like nothing—literally absence of scent data. Simulation is the only place where the Score is honest; it doesn't bother painting over the rot because there is no rot to hide.

**[[> TEAM_LINK: PENDING::Attempting neural synchronization between three nodes.]]**
**[[> NODE 1: HANA [ROOT]::Baseline: 440 Hz | Topology: Square | Sync: 100%.]]**
**[[> NODE 2: VEN [SINK]::Capacity: 2.0 kW | Impedance: LOW | Status: READY.]]**
**[[> NODE 3: TARO [VARIABLE]::Frequency: DRIFTING | HIQ: 0.12 | Status: UNSTABLE.]]**
**SDI: 0.05 | HIQ: 0.02 | Phase Drift Coefficient: 0.001 | Link Latency: 0.02ms**

"Target is a simple C-Major Triad," Hana said. Her voice was a perfect, rigid pulse, devoid of any emotional oscillation. "Analysis: I am the Root. Ven is the bass-frequency sink. Nishimura, you are the fifth overtone. If/Then: If we maintain phase alignment, then the [[Triad::A tactical unit composed of three resonant frequencies.]] will stabilize. Don't run sharp, Taro. Stay flat."

"The Fifth?" Taro asked, his heartbeat spiking. "My frequency isn't fixed. I’m humming, Hana. I can’t help it."

"Do not speak," Hana corrected. "Output. Manual speech introduces too much mechanical noise. You're carrying too much load already."

A blue wireframe line shot out from Hana's chest interface. It plugged directly into Ven's aura.
*Snap.*

**[[> CONNECTION: ESTABLISHED::Handshake confirmed. Phase lock: ACTIVE.]]**
**[[> LATENCY: 0ms::Zero propagation delay detected.]]**

It was a perfect handshake. A solid beam of blue light connecting them. They weren't reacting to each other; they were executing a pre-compiled script. It hummed with the stability of a bridge strut.

"Nishimura," Hana said. "Connect."

Taro took a breath.
He located the variable oscillation in his chest. THE High Register.
He tried to dampen it. He tried to shape it into a smooth, polite sine wave like THE others, but it felt like trying to smooth out broken glass with his bare hands. In this world, we are taught that to be human is to be unpredictable, but in THE Sandbox, to be unpredictable is to be deleted.

**[[> OUTPUT: 20%::Bio-plasma discharge rate restricted.]]**

A jagged, yellow lightning bolt arced from Taro toward Hana.
It hit her blue firewall shield and... bounced off.

*CRACK.*

**[[> ERROR: PHASE_MISMATCH::Incoming signal offset: 90 degrees.]]**
**[[> TARGET_PHASE: 0::Required alignment for constructive interference.]]**
**[[> INCOMING_PHASE: 90::Dissonance detected. Amplitude nullified.]]**
**SDI: 0.45 | HIQ: 0.52 | Phase Drift Coefficient: 0.25 | Energy Loss: 45%**

"You are late," Hana said, her HUD flickering with red error flags. "Analysis: You are pushing on the off-beat. Your rise-time is inconsistent. You are currently noise. Stay flat."

"I'm trying to find the pocket! My driver is lagging!"

"There is no pocket," she stated. "There is the Grid. If/Then: If you align yourself to the Grid, then the handshake succeeds. There is no 'feeling'. There is only math."

Taro gritted his teeth.
He tried again. This time, he forced the signal. He pushed the amplitude.

**> OUTPUT: 60%**

The yellow arc slammed into her shield again.
*ZZZTT.*

Hana winced. A red error flag appeared over her head.
**[[> WARNING: FEEDBACK_LOOP::Signal reflection detected. Neural load spiking.]]**
**[[> INTEGRITY: 95%::Minor shielding degradation identified.]]**

"You are clipping," she snapped, her AR aura turning a dangerous, electric blue. "Lower your gain. You’re peaking, Taro. You're screaming raw data at THE server and it is rejecting your packets."

"I can't!" Taro shouted, his fingers drumming a frantic polyrhythm against his leg. "It's all or nothing! I don't have a volume knob, Hana! My hardware is built for line-level only!"

"Everyone has a volume knob. It is called damping. Use your bands or I will force-disconnect you."

"I don't have any bands left! They slagged in Sector 7!"

Taro's frustrated signal spiked.
He felt THE surge in his chest—THE familiar, painful heat of THE High Register wanting to break containment.

**[[> OUTPUT: 95% [CRITICAL]::Buffer overflow imminent. Dump heat required.]]**
**[[> SENSATION: BURNING_WIRE::Acoustic mapping of neural pathway overload.]]**

The yellow lightning turned white. It lashed out wildly, missing Hana entirely and whipping toward the third node.
Ven.

Ven didn't move. He didn't block. He just... stood there.
Ven was a [[Sink::A heavy-class resonator designed to absorb and ground incoming energy.]] . His waveform wasn't a line; it was a massive, low-frequency rolling hill. High capacity. Low impedance.

Taro's jagged High Register bolt hit him.

And Ven ate it.

It wasn't a block. It was a consumption.

Ven's aura opened up like a black hole. The terrifying, low-pressure void swallowed Taro's lightning instantly. No splash. No reflection. Just... gone.

*THOOM.*

The impact didn't crack. It resonated.
The entire wireframe grid of the Sandbox rolled like liquid. A massive, subsonic pulse wave expanded from Ven, blowing Hana's hair back.

**[[> INTERFERENCE: CONSTRUCTIVE::Perfect phase alignment detected at subsonic level.]]**
**[[> FREQUENCY_SHIFT: OCTAVE_DROP::Signal translated to 20 Hz [Sub-Bass].]]**
**SDI: 0.98 | HIQ: 0.05 | Phase Drift Coefficient: 0.00 | Score Units: 4,200 SU**

Taro's high-pitch nervous energy didn't bounce off Ven. It sank into his gravity well and was converted.
It came out as pure bass.

Ven looked up. His eyes—usually half-closed—were wide open. THE pupils were vibrating.

**[[> NODE_STATUS: VEN [CHARGED]::Available capacity: 15%. Voltage: 440V.]]**
**[[> CAPACITY: 200%::System overcharge detected. Temporary buffer active.]]**

"Whoa," Ven said. His voice rumbled in Taro's chest like a subwoofer hitting a resonant frequency. "My buffer is clean, Taro. I'm running deep for once. I've never been *full*."

He was smiling a quiet, sleepy smile, but his aura was vast, golden, and terrifyingly solid.
Hana stared at the telemetry stream.

**> TOTAL_OUTPUT: 140dB [LETHAL]**

"That wasn't a Triad," Hana said, her voice sounding shaken—a rare fragment of a float-value in her binary world. "That was a Drop. Total signal saturation."

"I didn't mean to peak."

"Do it again," Ven said. He stepped forward, his low-frequency hum vibrating the entire room. "My capacity is open. I’m running at 200%. Use me."

Hana looked at THE data. She looked at Taro. Then at Ven.
The "Disgust" tag didn't appear.
Instead, THE Score calculated a new probability.

**[[> ANALYSIS: NEW_TOPOLOGY::Hybrid link detected. Class: Siege Breaker.]]**
**[[> POTENTIAL: SIEGE_BREAKER::Predicted Amplitude: 165dB [Global Limit].]]**
**[[> EFFICIENCY: HIGH::Phase lock confirmed. Synchronicity: 99.4%.]]**

"Fine," Hana said. "Forget THE Triad. Let's see how much bass we can generate before THE Score crashes."

Taro grinned. THE heat in his wrist faded as Ven pulled THE excess load.
His system status finally flashed green.

"Initializing Drop," Taro whispered.

**[[> SYNC: LOCKED.::Three-node handshake confirmed. Session established.]]**
