### [09:15:00] THE HANDSHAKE

"Initialize," Hana commanded.

They stood in a triangle. Taro, Hana, and the large student known as Ven.

The Sandbox was a void. A "Null State" environment where the Academy server suspended standard physics textures to save processing power. No walls. No floor. Just a glowing wireframe grid projected beneath their boots. It smelled like nothing—literally absence of scent data.

**> TEAM_LINK: PENDING**
**> NODE 1: HANA [ROOT]**
**> NODE 2: VEN [SINK]**
**> NODE 3: TARO [VARIABLE]**

"Target is a simple C-Major Triad," Hana said. Her voice was a perfect, rigid pulse, devoid of any emotional jitter. "Analysis: I am the Root. Ven is the bass-frequency sink. Nishimura, you are the fifth overtone. If/Then: If we maintain phase alignment, then the [[Triad::A standard tactical unit composed of three resonant frequencies: Root (Command), Third (Support), and Fifth (Offense).]] will stabilize."

"The Fifth?" Taro asked, his heartbeat spiking. "My... uh... my frequency isn't fixed. I jitter."

"Do not speak," Hana corrected. "Output. Manual speech introduces too much mechanical noise."

A blue wireframe line shot out from Hana's chest interface. It plugged directly into Ven's aura.
*Snap.*

**> CONNECTION: ESTABLISHED**
**> LATENCY: 0ms**

It was a perfect handshake. A solid beam of blue light connecting them. They weren't reacting to each other; they were executing a pre-compiled script.
It hummed with the stability of a bridge strut.

"Nishimura," Hana said. "Connect."

Taro took a breath.
He located the variable oscillation in his chest. The High Register.
He tried to dampen it. He tried to shape it into a smooth, polite sine wave like the others. but it felt like trying to smooth out broken glass with his bare hands.

**> OUTPUT: 20%**

A jagged, yellow lightning bolt arced from Taro toward Hana.
It hit her blue firewall shield and... bounced off.

*CRACK.*

**> ERROR: PHASE_MISMATCH**
**> TARGET_PHASE: 0**
**> INCOMING_PHASE: 90**

"You are late," Hana said, her HUD flickering with red error flags. "Analysis: You are pushing on the off-beat. Your rise-time is inconsistent. You are currently noise."

"I'm trying to find the pocket! My... my driver is lagging!"

"There is no pocket," she stated. "There is the Grid. If/Then: If you align yourself to the Grid, then the handshake succeeds. There is no 'feeling'. There is only math."

Taro gritted his teeth.
He tried again. This time, he forced the signal. He pushed the amplitude.

**> OUTPUT: 60%**

The yellow arc slammed into her shield again.
*ZZZTT.*

Hana winced. A red error flag appeared over her head.
**> WARNING: FEEDBACK_LOOP**
**> INTEGRITY: 95%**

"You are clipping," she snapped, her AR aura turning a dangerous, electric blue. "Lower your gain. You are peaking. You are screaming raw data at the server and it is rejecting your packets."

"I can't!" Taro shouted, his fingers drumming a frantic polyrhythm against his leg. "It's... zzt... it's all or nothing! I don't have a volume potentiometer! My hardware is built for line-level only!"

"Everyone has a volume knob. It is called Damping. Use your bands or I will force-disconnect you."

"I don't have any bands left! They slagged in Sector 7!"

Taro's frustrated signal spiked.
He felt the surge in his chest—the familiar, painful heat of the High Register wanting to break containment.

**> OUTPUT: 95% [CRITICAL]**
**> SENSATION: BURNING_WIRE**

The yellow lightning turned white. It lashed out wildly, missing Hana entirely and whipping toward the third node.
Ven.

Ven didn't move. He didn't block. He just... stood there.
Ven was a [[Sink::A heavy-class resonator designed to absorb and ground incoming kinetic/acoustic energy, converting it to waste heat or stored bass potential.]] . His waveform wasn't a line; it was a massive, low-frequency rolling hill. High capacity. Low impedance.

Taro's jagged High Register bolt hit him.

And Ven ate it.

It wasn't a block. It was a *consumption*.

Ven's aura opened up like a black hole. The terrifying, low-pressure void swallowed Taro's lightning instantly. No splash. No reflection. Just... gone.

*THOOM.*

The impact didn't crack. It resonated.
The entire wireframe grid of the Sandbox rolled like liquid. A massive, subsonic pulse wave expanded from Ven, blowing Hana's hair back.

**> INTERFERENCE: CONSTRUCTIVE**
**> FREQUENCY_SHIFT: OCTAVE_DROP**

Taro's high-pitch nervous energy didn't bounce off Ven. It sank into his gravity well and was converted.
It came out as **Pure Bass**.

Ven looked up. His eyes—usually half-closed—were wide open. The pupils were vibrating.

**> NODE_STATUS: VEN [CHARGED]**
**> CAPACITY: 200%**

"Whoa," Ven said. His voice rumbled in Taro's chest like a subwoofer hitting a resonant frequency. "I'm... I'm high-res for once. My buffer is completely clear."

He was smiling a quiet, sleepy smile, but his aura was vast, golden, and terrifyingly solid.
Hana stared at the telemetry stream.

**> TOTAL_OUTPUT: 140dB [LETHAL]**

"That wasn't a Triad," Hana said, her voice sounding shaken—a rare fragment of a float-value in her binary world. "That was a Drop. Total signal saturation."

"I didn't... uh... I didn't mean to peak."

"Do it again," Ven said. He stepped forward, his low-frequency hum vibrating the entire room. "My capacity is open. I’ve never been at 100% before. I've never been *full*."

Hana looked at the data. She looked at Taro. Then at Ven.
The "Disgust" tag didn't appear.
Instead, the system calculated a new probability.

**> ANALYSIS: NEW_TOPOLOGY**
**> POTENTIAL: SIEGE_BREAKER**
**> EFFICIENCY: HIGH**

"Fine," Hana said. "Forget the Triad. Let's see how much bass we can generate before the server crashes."

Taro grinned. The heat in his wrist faded as Ven pulled the excess load.
His system status finally flashed green.

"Initializing Drop," Taro whispered.

**> SYNC: LOCKED.**
