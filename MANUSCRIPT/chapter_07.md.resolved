### [14:30:00] MIL-SPEC

The Combat Sim didn't look like the rest of the Academy.
The beautiful 8K textures were gone. The walls were untextured gray polygons. The lighting was flat white.

**> RENDERING: PERFORMANCE_MODE**
**> FPS: MAX**

"Simulation Alpha," the announcer's voice boomed. "Nishimura vs. Staccato."

I stood in the center of the arena. My HUD was already sweating red text.

**> OPPONENT_DETECTED**
**> ID: MARCUS_STACCATO [YEAR 2]**
**> CLASS: RHYTHM_OPERATOR**
**> FACTION: G_VANGUARD**
**> THREAT: SEVERE**

Marcus didn't look like a student. He looked like hardware.
He wore the standard Vanguard carapace armor, but his was customized. Matte black. No reflections.
And his aura?
My high-bandwidth eyes couldn't read it.

**> SCANNING...**
**> ERROR: ENCRYPTION_DETECTED**
**> SIGNAL: MASKED [MIL-SPEC]**

He was running a jammer. To me, he was just a black hole in the data stream.

"You're the 880," Marcus said. His voice was choppy. Percussive. "The Glitch."
He didn't walk. He *ticked* forward.

*Step. Step. Step.*

Every footfall was perfectly timed to a 140 BPM clock.
My HUD tried to draw a predictive path for him, but the line kept snapping.

**> PREDICTION_CONFIDENCE: LOW**

"Voss says you have potential," Marcus said. He pulled a baton from his belt. "I say you have slop."

*CLICK.*

The baton extended. A glowing red tuning fork at the tip.
**> WEAPON: TEMPO_ROD [300 Hz]**

"Begin," the announcer said.

Marcus vanished.

**[FRAME_SKIP]**

One second he was ten meters away. The next frame, he was in my face.
My HUD shrieked.

**> PROXIMITY_ALE--**

*CRACK.*

The baton hit my ribs.
It wasn't just a hit. It was a **Downbeat**.
The impact forced my entire nervous system to reset. My lungs froze. My vision greyscaled.

**> STATUS: STUNNED**
**> SYNC: FORCED_RESET**

I stumbled back, gasping. "How..."

"You operate on analog time," Marcus said, circling me. "I operate on Grid Time. I am moving between your refresh rate."

He was right.
To my eyes, he was glitching. He appeared in flashes.
He was exploiting the latency of my own brain.

"Fight back," he ordered.

I gritted my teeth.
*Ignore the visuals. Focus on the hum.*
I pulled on the 880 Hz. I didn't try to clamp it this time. I let it scream.

**> OUTPUT: 80%**
**> TOPOLOGY: SAWTOOTH_BURST**

I threw a wave of jagged noise at him. A wide cone of distortion. You couldn't dodge it.

Marcus didn't dodge.
He *parried* the sound.

He swung his baton in a perfect vertical arc. The red 300 Hz tip cut through my yellow 880 Hz wave like a hot knife through styrofoam.

**> INTERFERENCE: DESTRUCTIVE**
**> ATTACK: NULLIFIED**

My wave dissolved.
Marcus stepped through the dissipating sparks.

"Sloppy," he said. "High amplitude. Zero structure. You're just shouting."

He raised the baton.
"This is how you speak."

He tapped the air.
*Click-click-click.*
Three rapid strikes. A triplet pattern.

The air solidified. The sound waves he created didn't dissipate; they hung in the air, forming a physical cage of red light around me.

**> TRAP_DETECTED: RHYTHM_CAGE**
**> ESCAPE_PATH: NONE**

"End of simulation," Marcus said.

He tapped the cage.
*PING.*

The resonance collapsed inward.
It hit me from all sides.
My HUD turned static.
My sound output flatlined.

**> CRITICAL_FAILURE**
**> SYSTEM_REBOOTING...**

I was on the floor. Groaning.
Marcus stood over me. He deactivated his jammer for one second.
I saw his true stats.

**> SYNC: 99%**
**> EFFICIENCY: 100%**
**> EMOTION: BOREDOM**

"Get a metronome, Glitch," he said, holstering his rod. "Or don't come back."

He walked away.
*Step. Step. Step.*
Perfect 140 BPM.

I lay there, watching the red "DEFEAT" banner scroll across my vision.
Ven and Hana were running toward me from the sidelines.
But I wasn't looking at them.
I was looking at the replay buffer in my mind.

I didn't lose because I was weak.
I lost because I tried to drown him, and he just... swam.
