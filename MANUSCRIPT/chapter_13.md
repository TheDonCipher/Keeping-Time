### [TIME: 07:00:00] REBOOT

Taro opened his eyes.

The world was beautiful.
The ceiling was a perfect, seamless white, rendered in 8K resolution. The light filtering through the window wasn't just light; it was a volumetric simulation of a "Perfect Morning," complete with dust motes dancing in the sunbeams.

He sat up.
No headache. No lag. No stutter.
His body felt light. Efficient. Optimized.

**> DIAGNOSTIC: ALL_SYSTEMS_GO**
**> SYNC_RATE: 100%**
**> MOOD: CALM**

He looked at his hands.
They weren't wireframes. They weren't glitching. They were high-fidelity skin textures, perfectly mapped to his bone structure. He could see the pores. He could see the fingerprints.

"It worked," he whispered.
His voice was smooth. Resonant. A perfect Baritone.

He got out of bed.
The floor was warm.
The air smelled like lavender and ozone.

He walked to the mirror in the corner of the room.
The reflection stared back.
It was Taro. But... better.
His posture was straighter. His eyes were bright, clear, and focused. The dark circles under them were gone. The nervous tic in his cheek was gone.

And around his neck...
A new collar.
Sleek. Black. Matte finish.
It hummed with a low, barely audible frequency. A calming wave.

"Taro?"

He turned around.
Ven was standing in the doorway.
He looked... clean. His heavy armor was polished to a mirror shine. His face was relaxed, devoid of the usual tension.

"Hey," Taro said. "You okay?"

"I'm great," Ven smiled. It was a wide, easy smile. "My thermal load is stable at 40%. The cooling system they installed is... it's amazing. I feel light."

Ven walked over and patted Taro on the shoulder.
The impact was gentle. Controlled.
No sparks. No heat dump.

"They fixed us, Taro," Ven said. "Voss... he actually fixed us. No more overloads. No more glitching. We're compatible."

"Compatible," Taro repeated. The word tasted sweet. Like artificial sweetener.

"Hana is waiting in the courtyard," Ven said. "Class starts in ten minutes. We’re going to be late for formations."

"Formations?"

"Yeah. The Triad drill. We're going to nail it this time. Perfect C-Major."

Taro followed Ven out into the hallway.
The dorms were quiet. Orderly.
Students walked in straight lines. They nodded politely as Taro passed.
**> GREETING: [POLITE_NOD]**
**> STATUS: ACCEPTED**

They walked out into the courtyard.
The sky was the same perfect blue Taro remembered from Sector 4.
Golden dome. No clouds. No rain.

Hana was standing by the fountain.
She looked radiant. Her uniform was crisp, her hair perfectly styled. Her aura was a stable, glowing blue square wave.

"Target sighted," she announced, her voice lacking its usual robotic edge. It sounded... human. Almost *too* human. "Good morning, Nishimura. Your latency is zero. Impressive."

"Hi, Hana," Taro said.

"We have a lot of work to do," she said, tapping her datapad. "But first... the Headmaster wanted me to give you this."

She handed him a small, white box.
Taro opened it.

Inside were his **Analog Headphones**.
Cleaned. Repaired.
But looking at them... they felt wrong.
Heavy. Clunky. Obsolete.

"He said you can keep them," Hana said smiling. "As a souvenir. You don't need them anymore, obviously. The new firmware filters out all background noise automatically."

Taro looked at the headphones.
Then he looked at the world.
It was perfect.
It was quiet.
It was safe.

And it was a complete and total lie.

He could see the edges of the render if he squinted. He could feel the artificial smoothness of the air. He remembered the Void. He remembered the raw data screaming beneath the pavement.
The "Patch" hadn't fixed the world.
It had just blinded him to the cracks.

But his friends were smiling.
Ven wasn't burning. Hana wasn't glitching.
They were happy.

Taro closed the box.
"Yeah," he said, forcing his own perfect smile. "I don't need them anymore."

**> LIE_DETECTED [INTERNAL]**
**> MASKING_PROTOCOL: ACTIVE**
**> MOOD: [PRETENDING]**

He put the box in his pocket.
"Let's go," Taro said. "We have a Triad to form."

He walked into the sunlight.
The collar around his neck hummed.
It felt cold.
