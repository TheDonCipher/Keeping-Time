## Chapter 13: The Patch

**ZONE: C-ORDER_MEDICAL_WARD [SECTOR 1]**
**STATUS: REBOOTING...**
**UPDATE: 99% COMPLETE**

### [12:00:00] THE NEW DRIVER

The pain was digital. A needle of white light threading through his frontal lobe.
Then, the progress bar hit **100%**.

**> UPDATE_COMPLETE**
**> EXECUTING: HIGH_FIDELITY_RENDERER**

The world snapped.
The blue wireframe mesh of the medical ward didn't just fade; it was aggressively paved over by textures. The flat grey polygons of the walls erupted into brushed steel and sterilized plastic. The low-poly light sources bloomed into complex volumetric glows, casting soft, ray-traced shadows across the floor.

It was violent. Like being slapped in the face with reality.

Taro gasped, his hands gripping the sheets.
They were sheets again. Cotton. Thread count 200. He could feel the friction data.

**> SENSORY_DRIVERS: ONLINE**
**> HAPTICS: CALIBRATED**

"Easy," Voss said.
Voss wasn't a polygon anymore. He was a high-resolution human being. Taro could see the pores on his skin, the wear on his uniform's collar, the micro-scratches on his silver badge.
But there was something else.

Taro blinked.
Overlaid on Voss’s chest, beneath the fabric of his coat, was a faint, pulsing schematic.
A red line tracing his aorta.
A blue line tracing his nervous system.

**> TARGET: EREN VOSS**
**> BPM: 72 [STEADY]**
**> STRESS: 0%**
**> RESONANCE_POTENTIAL: 660 Hz [MODERATE]**

"What did you do?" Taro whispered.

"I removed the parental controls," Voss said. He didn't seem to notice that Taro was staring at his internal organs. "The standard NAI firmware filters out 40% of the world's data. It hides the messy parts. The structural weaknesses. The biological noise. It keeps the population calm."

Voss tapped his own temple.
"Project Dissonance disables those filters. You don't just see the UI anymore, Taro. You see the source code."

Taro looked around the room.
It was overwhelming.
The walls weren't just solid barriers; they were stress maps. He could see where the load-bearing beams were under tension (yellow lines). He could see a hairline fracture in the window glass (flashing red).

He looked at his own hand.
He could see the bio-plasma flowing under his skin like liquid gold.
It looked... hungry.

**> VITALITY: 100%**
**> LIMITER: NONE**

"Where is my ring?" Taro asked. He touched his neck. It was bare.

"You don't need a limiter," Voss said. "Limiters are for people who might accidentally break the rules. You are not going to break the rules, Taro. You are going to rewrite them. But if you crash again..."
Voss’s eyes went cold.
"...there is no Safe Mode. The next crash is fatal. Do you understand?"

"Yes."

"Good. Initiate discharge protocol."

### [13:15:00] THE REUNION

Ven and Hana were waiting in the lobby.
To anyone else, they looked like two worried students.
To Taro, they looked like chaotic storms of data.

Ven was a walking furnace. The air shimmered around him. His resonance wasn't just 'grounded'; it was a heavy, dense gravitational field that bent the light around his shoulders.
**> VEN_STATUS: THERMAL_CAPACITY [80%]**

Hana was a razor. Her edges were too sharp. Her harmony wasn't peaceful; it was a high-tension wire waiting to snap.
**> HANA_STATUS: VIBRATION [HIGH_FREQUENCY]**

They stood up when they saw him.
"Taro!" Hana moved first, bridging the gap. She grabbed his shoulders. "You're... you're high-res again."

"I'm back," Taro said.
He looked at her. Really looked at her.
He could see the worry lines rendered in wireframe under her skin. He could see the jagged spike in her pulse rate.
**> EMOTION: RELIEF [GENUINE]**

"They said you burned out," Ven rumbled, stepping up behind her. "They said you hit 3 million output. That's impossible, Taro. That's a bomb, not a student."

"It was a glitch," Taro lied. The word tasted synthetic.
**> SOCIAL_PROTOCOL: DECEPTION [ACTIVE]**

"Voss fixed it," Taro added. "He gave me a patch."

Ven narrowed his eyes. He looked at Taro's neck.
"Where's your collar?"

"Upgrade," Taro said. "Internal software limiter. No hardware required."

Use the lie. Keep the system stable.
Taro looked past them, out the glass doors of the medical center.
The city of Malkuth sprawled out before them. The towers of the High-Fidelity zone gleamed in the afternoon sun.

But Taro didn't see the gleaming towers.
He saw the structural fatigue in the bridges.
He saw the energy leaks in the power grid.
He saw the stress fractures in the pavement.

The world wasn't perfect. It was breaking. It was holding itself together with tape and prayers.
And for the first time, he saw exactly where to hit it.

**> OBJECTIVE: RETURN_TO_ACADEMY**
**> PHASE_IV: COMPLETE**
