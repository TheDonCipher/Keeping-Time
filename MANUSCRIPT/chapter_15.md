# KEEPING TIME
## Chapter 15: The Phantom Mesh

### [03:42:00] THE MIRROR

The practice annex was a hollow vault of silence, an authorized rehearsal tier where the environmental fidelity was pushed to its high-resolution limit. Outside, the Academy was in its night cycle, the local server humming in a low-load state. But inside, my neural-acoustic masking layer was failing, a twelve-percent variance causing the world to stutter.

The mirror was lying. Or maybe it was THE only thing telling THE truth.

Taro gripped THE edge of THE porcelain sink, THE cold ceramic grounding him against THE vertigo. The dormitory was asleep. THE silence in THE bathroom was heavy, broken only by THE hum of THE ventilation fans.

He stared at his reflection.

To THE C-Order, he was Cadet Taro. Hero of THE breach. Survivor of THE Void. A harmonic anomaly that could be weaponized. The mirror showed a young man with sharp features, dark hair, and THE faint, glowing seams of THE Patch Voss had installed running along his neck.

But then, he blinked.

*Flicker.*

For a microsecond, THE texture map of his face popped. THE skin, THE hair, THE bone structure—it all vanished, replaced by a jagged, screaming wireframe of raw blue light. It wasn't just a wrong note. It was a completely different shape.

The Cadet Taro [[Hull::The AR social skin that the world sees—a polished, stable major chord of flesh designed to hide the dissonance underneath.]] was symmetrical, solid, harmonious. A major chord made of flesh. THE wireframe underneath was jagged, asymmetrical, splintered. A dissonant chord struggling to break free.

My HUD flared with warnings. <em>Hull integrity compromised.</em> The internal signal was exceeding the social filter's capacity, a vertex conflict causing the rendering variance to spike as my internal geometry failed to match the mask. <em>ERROR: INTERNAL_GEOMETRY_MISMATCH.</em> SDI: 0.14, HIQ: 0.12.

Taro gasped, splashing cold water on his face. He scrubbed at his skin, as if he could wash away the blue light.

"It's just the patch," he whispered to the empty room. "It's just the new driver. Stay flat. Level out."

But he knew it wasn't.

He had felt this "wrongness" his entire life. The feeling that his skin was too tight. The feeling that the song the world wanted him to sing was in a key he couldn't reach. The C-Order called it "chaos." Voss called it "corruption." But looking at the wireframe—that sharp, electric, terrifying shape—Taro realized it wasn't corruption. 

It was him. The raw signal.

The "Cadet" in the mirror was the mask. The "Wrong Note" was the person.

He squeezed his eyes shut. The dysphoria washed over him—an ontological nausea that felt like a permanent stuttering lag. Being "corrected" by the system, being "patched" by Voss... it felt like being deleted, bit by bit, to free up space for a version of himself he didn't even recognize. He was carrying too much load, and the cooling systems were failing.

His processing was pegged at 100%. He needed to dump heat.

He needed to get out. The air in the dorms was too thick. Too ordered. Too clean.

### [04:15:00] THE PRACTICE ROOM

He wandered the academy grounds, aiming for the practice wing. It was the only place where the acoustics were dampened enough to drown out the constant, judging hum of the city.

He walked past the perfectly manicured gardens. The cherry blossoms were glowing, their petals forced into a permanent, artificial bloom by an environmental script that refused to let them fade. <em>[FORCE_BLOOM: TRUE].</em>

*Everything here is forced,* he thought. *Everything is performing.*

He reached THE practice annex. He scanned his ID. THE door to Room 404 chimed and slid open.

He stepped inside... and froze.

Someone was already there.

In THE center of THE dark room, illuminated only by THE holographic emitters, a figure was playing a cello.

It was a senior cadet. Taro recognized THE uniform. Kimura. "The Tank." A heavy-set, broad-shouldered guy known for defensive harmonics and unshakeable stability.

But Kimura wasn't stabilizing anything right now.

Kimura was wrong noting.

Taro watched, breath held, as THE cadet played a melody so fragile and high-pitched it made Taro's teeth ache. And with every note, THE "Tank" hull flickered.

*Pop.*
*Hiss.*

The broad shoulders vanished, revealing a slender, radiant wireframe of light underneath. THE "masculine" jawline dissolved into a softer, sharper geometry.

Kimura was weeping. Silently. THE tears were glowing pixels, dripping onto THE floor and vanishing.

Taro didn't move. He should leave. This was private. This was THE most intimate, shameful thing a resonator could reveal—their structural failure.

But he couldn't look away.

Because looking at Kimura wrong noting... looking at that radiant wireframe fighting against THE heavy, suffocating hull... it was like looking in a mirror.

*He feels it too,* Taro realized. THE shock hit him harder than a sonic blast. *I'm not THE only one.*

Kimura stopped playing. THE bow screeching on THE strings.

The cadet spun around, sensing THE presence. THE "Tank" hull snapped back into place with a violent, sickening lurch. THE wireframe was buried again.

"Get out!" Kimura barked. THE voice was deep, forced. A "Command Voice."

Taro stepped into THE light. He didn't apologize. He didn't retreat.

"I saw it," Taro said.

Kimura went pale. "You saw nothing. Get out, First Year. Before I report you for a damping audit."

"I saw THE mesh," Taro said. He lifted his hand. He focused. He stopped fighting THE "wrongness" for just a second. He let THE "Cadet" mask slip.

*Flicker.*

Taro's hand dissolved into blue wireframe. Spiked. Jagged. Dissonant.

Kimura's eyes widened. THE anger drama away, replaced by a terrified recognition.

"You..." Kimura whispered.

"The hull doesn't fit," Taro said quietly. He let his hand solidify again. THE sensation of THE skin returning was heavy, like putting on a lead glove. "Does it? You’re carrying too much load."

Kimura lowered THE cello. THE heavy "Tank" posture slumped. For a moment, THE cadet didn't look like a soldier. Just a scared kid trapped in a suit of armor that didn't belong to them.

"No," Kimura said, THE voice cracking—THE deep "Command Voice" slipping into something truer, higher. "The hull... it's high-latency. It's always been lagging behind who I actually—zzt—am."

Taro walked over. He sat on THE floor, ignoring THE protocol that said he should stand at attention.

"They call it corruption," Taro said. "Voss says it's a fatal error."

"Resonance Dysphoria," Kimura corrected. "That's THE clinical term. A [[Pathological Misalignment::The clinical term for a soul that rejects its assigned frequency, leaving you a ghost in your own machine.]] between assigned frequency and internal geometry. Socially embarrassing, right?"

"I call it the truth," Taro said.

Kimura looked at him. "Truth is dangerous here, Taro. The System deletes errors. It wants us flat."

"Then we change the system," Taro said.

It was a treasonous thought. A dangerous thought. But sitting there in the dark, watching the "Wireframe Girl" hiding inside the "Tank Cadet," Taro felt something he hadn't felt since the crash.

He felt tuned.

"I'm Taro," he said.

Kimura hesitated. Then, a small, sad smile touched the corner of the heavy jawline.

"Elara," she whispered. "My name is Elara. I'm... I'm full-spectrum. I hear everything. And the system... it just wants me to be a single, flat note. It wants me to carry the load and never spike."

For the first time since the reboot, the noise in Taro's head went quiet. <em>Resonance sync confirmed.</em> The masking was off, our internal signals exposed in a raw, unfiltered acoustic data stream. <em>SIGNAL: UNFILTERED.</em> He wasn't alone in the static anymore. They were two wrong notes in a perfect machine, and for a brief, flickering moment, they were in phase.
