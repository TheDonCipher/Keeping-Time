### [03:42:00] THE MIRROR

The mirror was lying. Or maybe it was the only thing telling the truth.

Taro gripped the edge of the porcelain sink, the cold ceramic grounding him against the vertigo. The dormitory was asleep. The silence in the bathroom was heavy, broken only by the hum of the ventilation fans.

He stared at his reflection.

To the C-Order, he was Cadet Taro. Hero of the breach. Survivor of the Void. A "Harmonic Anomaly" that could be weaponized.
The mirror showed a young man with sharp features, dark hair, and the faint, glowing seams of the "Patch" Voss had installed running along his neck.

But then, he blinked.

*Flicker.*

For a microsecond, the texture map of his face popped. The skin, the hair, the bone structure—it all vanished, replaced by a jagged, screaming wireframe of raw blue light.

It wasn't just a wrong note. It was a completely different shape.

The "Cadet Taro" [[Hull::The projected 'Corrected Self' avatar that the NAI overlays on a user's physical body.]] was symmetrical, solid, harmonious. A Major Chord made of flesh.
The wireframe underneath was jagged, asymmetrical, splintered. A Dissonant Chord struggling to break free.

**> WARNING: HULL_INTEGRITY_COMPROMISED**
**> ERROR: INTERNAL_GEOMETRY_MISMATCH**

Taro gasped, splashing cold water on his face. He scrubbed at his skin, as if he could wash away the blue light.

"It's just the patch," he whispered to the empty room. "It's just the new driver."

But he knew it wasn't.

He had felt this "wrongness" his entire life. The feeling that his skin was too tight. The feeling that the "song" the world wanted him to sing was in a key he couldn't reach. The C-Order called it "Chaos." Voss called it "Corruption."

But looking at the wireframe—that sharp, electric, terrifying shape—Taro realized it wasn't corruption. 

It was *him*. The raw signal.

The "Cadet" in the mirror was the mask. The "Wrong Note" was the person.

He squeezed his eyes shut. The dysphoria washed over him—an ontological nausea that felt like a permanent stuttering lag. Being "Corrected" by the system, being "Patched" by Voss... it felt like being deleted, bit by bit, to free up space for a version of himself he didn't even recognize. 

His processing was pegged at 100%. He needed to dump heat.

He needed to get out. The air in the dorms was too thick. Too ordered.

### [04:15:00] THE PRACTICE ROOM

He wandered the academy grounds, aiming for the practice wing. It was the only place where the acoustics were dampened enough to drown out the constant, judging hum of the city.

He walked past the perfectly manicured gardens. The cherry blossoms were glowing. To his new vision, he saw the code keeping them in bloom: **[FORCE_BLOOM: TRUE]**.

*Everything here is forced,* he thought. *Everything is performing.*

He reached the practice annex. He scanned his ID. The door to Room 404 chimed and slid open.

He stepped inside... and froze.

Someone was already there.

In the center of the dark room, illuminated only by the holographic emitters, a figure was playing a cello.

It was a senior cadet. Taro recognized the uniform. Kimura. "The Tank." A heavy-set, broad-shouldered guy known for defensive harmonics and unshakeable stability.

But Kimura wasn't stabilizing anything right now.

Kimura was wrong noting.

Taro watched, breath held, as the cadet played a melody so fragile and high-pitched it made Taro's teeth ache. And with every note, the "Tank" hull flickered.

*Pop.*
*Hiss.*

The broad shoulders vanished, revealing a slender, radiant wireframe of light underneath. The "masculine" jawline dissolved into a softer, sharper geometry.

Kimura was weeping. Silently. The tears were glowing pixels, dripping onto the floor and vanishing.

Taro didn't move. He should leave. This was private. This was the most intimate, shameful thing a Resonator could reveal—their structural failure.

But he couldn't look away.

Because looking at Kimura wrong noting... looking at that radiant wireframe fighting against the heavy, suffocating hull... it was like looking in a mirror.

*He feels it too,* Taro realized. The shock hit him harder than a sonic blast. *I'm not the only one.*

Kimura stopped playing. The bow screeching on the strings.

The cadet spun around, sensing the presence. The "Tank" hull snapped back into place with a violent, sickening lurch. The wireframe was buried again.

"Get out!" Kimura barked. The voice was deep, forced. A "Command Voice."

Taro stepped into the light. He didn't apologize. He didn't retreat.

"I saw it," Taro said.

Kimura went pale. "You saw nothing. Get out, First Year. Before I report you for curfew violation."

"I saw the mesh," Taro said. He lifted his hand. He focused. He stopped fighting the "wrongness" for just a second. He let the "Cadet" mask slip.

*Flicker.*

Taro's hand dissolved into blue wireframe. Spiked. Jagged. Dissonant.

Kimura's eyes widened. The anger drained away, replaced by a terrified recognition.

"You..." Kimura whispered.

"The hull doesn't fit," Taro said quietly. He let his hand solidify again. The sensation of the skin returning was heavy, like putting on a lead glove. "Does it?"

Kimura lowered the cello. The heavy "Tank" posture slumped. For a moment, the cadet didn't look like a soldier. Just a scared kid trapped in a suit of armor that didn't belong to them.

"No," Kimura said, the voice cracking—the deep "Command Voice" slipping into something truer, higher. "The... the hull... it's high-latency. It's always been lagging behind who I actually--zzt--am."

Taro walked over. He sat on the floor, ignoring the protocol that said he should stand at attention.

"They call it corruption," Taro said. "Voss says it's a fatal error."

"Resonance Dysphoria," Kimura corrected. "That's the medical term. A [[Pathological Misalignment::A psychological rejection of one's assigned Frequency, treated by the C-Order via aggressive re-patterning or total system reset.]] between assigned frequency and internal geometry."

"I call it the truth," Taro said.

Kimura looked at him. "Truth is dangerous here, Taro. The System deletes errors."

"Then we change the System," Taro said.

It was a treasonous thought. A dangerous thought. But sitting there in the dark, watching the "Wireframe Girl" hiding inside the "Tank Cadet," Taro felt something he hadn't felt since the crash.

He felt tuned.

"I'm Taro," he said.

Kimura hesitated. Then, a small, sad smile touched the corner of the heavy jawline.

"Elara," she whispered. "My name is Elara. I'm... I'm full-spectrum. I hear everything. And the system... it just wants me to be a single, flat note."

**> DIALOGUE_EVENT: RESONANCE_SYNC**
**> STATUS: MASKING_OFF**
**> SIGNAL: UNFILTERED**

For the first time since the reboot, the noise in Taro's head went quiet. He wasn't alone in the static anymore. They were two wrong notes in a perfect machine, and for a brief, flickering moment, they were in phase.
