### [18:15:00] THE BLUE SCREEN

"I can't see anything," Hana whispered. Her voice was thin, losing its binary certainty.

She was tapping her temple, a frantic, jagged rhythm that didn't match the master clock. Her aura—usually a rigid Square Wave—was fraying at the edges. Tearing. The "Golden Filter" of the C-Order hadn't just faded. It had crashed. She was dropping frames, her perception lagging behind the darkness.

**> VISUAL_FEED: OFFLINE**
**> NAV_MESH: NOT_FOUND**

Taro looked at his own HUD. It was a mess of tearing pixels and scrolling error codes. The text was rendering backwards.
**> E_RROR... R_ETRY... K_ERNEL_P_ANIC...**

"The node," Ven rumbled. He held his heavy shield up, scanning the darkness. "It's jamming us. My buffer is filling up with junk data."

"It's not jamming," Taro said, his voice fragmenting. "Analysis: It's *absorbing*. It’s a total-sink."

Taro pointed to the scratch-etched circle on the wall. 
The Silence. 

It wasn't broadcasting noise. It was a sinkhole in the data. It was sucking the broadband out of the air like oxygen out of a depressurized cabin. It was an absolute-zero signal.

**> SIGNAL_FLOOR: -200dB [ABSENCE]**
**> PHYSICS_ENGINE: SUSPENDED**

It was [[The Silence::A rumored black-ops unit that doesn't use Resonance but consumes it, erasing targets from the server entirely.]] .

Taro reached for his neck.
He pulled the **Analog Headphones** up over his ears.
*Click.*
The hardware bypass engaged. The digital screaming of his crashed NAI faded, replaced by the warm, fuzzy silence of foam and copper.

Taro closed his eyes.
He listened.

Without the NAI, the world was dangerously quiet.
But the Analog Hardware picked up what the System ignored.
A footstep.
Soft. Cloth on stone.
No heart rate. No bio-plasma hum. Just mass in motion.

"Movement," Taro whispered, his analog-ears twitching. "Three targets. Twelve o'clock. High elevation. Their gain is zero."

"I have no lock," Hana hissed, her HUD a wall of static. "Analysis: Targeting system is offline. If/Then: If I cannot see the signal, then I must fire blindly."

"Don't fire," Taro said. "They want you to peak. They eat the amplitude. They’re broadband-leaches."

*Scrape.*

From the shadows above, three shapes dropped.
They didn't glow. They didn't have ID tags.
They were **Matte Black**.
Their suits absorbed 100% of visible light. They looked like moving holes in the reality render.

**> TARGET_ANALYSIS: [FAILED]**
**> OBJECT_CLASS: NULL**

They hit the ground without a sound.
No "Thud."
Just an absence of impact. The acoustic energy of their landing was swallowed instantly.

"Hana, Ven," Taro said. "Do not use Resonance."

"They are hostile!" Hana shouted. Panic overrode her logic. She raised her hand. "Protocol 4: Engage!"

"No!"

Hana fired.
A beam of pure Blue Light shot from her palm. A Standard Calibration Pulse.
It illuminated the alley for a microsecond.
The lead Silence agent stepped forward. He raised a black knife.
He didn't block the beam.
He *split* it.

The knife cut the frequency. The blue light hit the blade and vanished—eaten by the void. The air tasted like cold ash and missing packets.

It was a [[Null-Blade::Weapons coated in Void-Glass that absorb 100% of incident energy, capable of 'eating' Bio-Plasma shields.]] .

**> ATTACK: NULLIFIED**
**> ENERGY_DRAIN: DETECTED [EXTERNAL_SINK]**

Hana gasped and fell to her knees, clutching her chest. "My... my core... it’s losing voltage..."

"They drain Resonance," Taro screamed. "Ven! Don't ground them! You'll drain the whole grid!"

The agents stepped closer.
They moved like wrong notes. Jerky. Missing frames. Unnatural.

One raised a knife toward Hana.

Taro's mind raced.
Code didn't work. Resonance didn't work.
He needed something dumb. Something heavy. Something analog.

He tapped his thigh.
*One. Two. Three. Four.*

He grabbed a loose brick from the crumbling wall.
**> OBJECT: MASONRY_UNIT [SOLID]**
**> TECH_LEVEL: PRIMITIVE**

Taro generated a High Register pulse.
But he didn't project it. He held it. He internalized it.
**> MODE: VIBRATION_ONLY**

He threw the brick.
Not at the agent.
At the wall behind him.

*PANG.*

The brick hit a rusted pipe.
The pipe rang out. A sharp, dissonant C-sharp.
Crucially, it wasn't bio-plasma. It was **Kinetic Noise**. Broad-spectrum acoustic trauma.

The agent flinched.
For a microsecond, the void in the data cracked. The agent turned toward the sound.
The "Silence Field" fluctuated.

**> VULNERABILITY_DETECTED: INTERFERENCE_POINT**
**> WINDOW: 500ms**

"Ven!" Taro shouted. "Hit the pipe! Total analog strike! Dump your heat into the steel!"

Ven didn't ask questions. He didn't use resonance.
He used his metal fist.

*CLANG.*

The pipe screamed.
The sound wave was physical. It hammered the air.
The Agents hissed. They covered their ears.
They were immune to the refined magic of the Concord.
But they weren't immune to Physics.

"Run!" Taro grabbed Hana's arm.

They sprinted into the dark.
