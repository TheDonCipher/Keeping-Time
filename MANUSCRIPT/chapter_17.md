# KEEPING TIME
## Chapter 17: The Underground

### [23:45:00] THE DESCENT

The elevator descended past the city's roots. We were in an unauthorized tier, the sub-bass levels of Sector 4 where the signal floor was a crushing -120dB. The system time showed 23:45:00, the local server status offline as we entered a restricted zone. My HUD flared with warnings—we were leaving network coverage, the global sync hitting zero percent as the handshake failed.

Floor -10: Maintenance.
Floor -20: Waste Reclamation.
Floor -30: Geothermal Tap.

Taro watched the signal strength drop bar by bar, eighty-five percent of his packets already lost to the depths. <em>[|||||] ... [|||..] ... [|....]</em>

When the last bar vanished, a strange sensation washed over him. The constant, high-pitched hum of the C-Order Network—the carrier wave that connected every Score port in the city—cut out.

Silence. Real, heavy, analog silence.

The elevator doors groaned open. The air here was thick, smelling of ozone and old coolant.

"Welcome to the Dead Zone," Elara said. Her voice was already starting to wrong note without the C-Order to smooth her formants. "No network coverage down here. Total analog territory. You can finally stop trying to stay flat."

She was standing next to him, but she looked... unstable. Without the Network to enforce her Hull ID, her "Tank" avatar was flickering violently. The heavy shoulders were phasing in and out of existence, revealing the wireframe light beneath.

"This way," she said, her voice dropping into a grainier, lower resolution.

They walked down a rusted maintenance tunnel. The walls were lined with copper mesh—a makeshift [[Faraday Cage::A primitive but effective shield that kills the system's voice, leaving only the sound of your own heart.]] .

At the end of the tunnel was a heavy blast door. No digital lock. No retinal scanner. Just a wheel valve.

Elara spun it. The door creaked open. My sensors detected an unregistered frequency cluster, the acoustic pressure hitting an extreme 120dB of non-standard chaos. 4,200 Score Units were generated in an instant. SDI: 0.99, HIQ: 0.99. Phase Drift Coefficient: 1.00.

The sound hit them like a physical wave.

It wasn't the polite, quantized music of the Upper City. It was a riot of genres, a clash of time signatures, a polyphonic storm of individuality.

### [00:00:00] THE NULL

Taro stepped inside. The club, simply called "The Null," was a cavernous space carved out of an old geothermal vent. It was the [[Underground::A sanctuary for dissonant users who refuse to be tuned, a place where the only rule is to play your own song.]] .

In the center of the dance floor, a small circle of light had formed around two people. They weren't dancing; they were holding hands, their eyes locked as they recited wedding vows in a perfect, rapid-fire tempo that matched the 170 BPM drum-and-bass track pounding through the floor. A "Frequency Priest" stood over them, his hands moving in a rhythmic blessing that synced their two heartbeats into a single, unshakeable signature. In the Null, love wasn't a feeling; it was a shared cadence.

The visual data was overwhelming.

In the Upper City, everyone looked like a variation of a standard template: The Worker, The Soldier, The Leader. Everyone was compatible. Everyone was flat.
Here, there were no templates.

Taro saw a girl whose resonance took the shape of a storm cloud, lightning crackling around her fingers as she danced.
He saw a guy whose avatar was a geometric abstract—a floating collection of cubes and pyramids that shifted to the beat of the drum and bass.
He saw people with impossible colors, impossible geometries, impossible sounds.

"System-Free," Elara shouted over the music, her voice now a clean, uncompressed treble that cut through the low-pass filter of the tunnel. "No Hull IDs. No stabilizers. No Hi-Fi lies. Just raw output. No one here cares if you run sharp."

She grabbed his arm and pulled him toward the center of the room.

"Watch."

She closed her eyes. She took a deep breath. And then, she let go.

The "Tank" hull didn't just wrong note—it shattered. The heavy white uniform, the broad shoulders, the square jaw—it all exploded into pixels and dissolved.

And from the debris rose the Wireframe.

It wasn't just a skeleton anymore. In the signal-free air of the Null, the texture map loaded. Elara was radiant. She was made of neon-blue glass and starlight. Her form was slender, sharp, and terrifyingly fast. She moved like a frequency spike, a living treble clef slicing through the heavy air.

She laughed—a sound like chimes in a windstorm—and spun, her cello (materialized from pure data) appearing in her hands. She drew the bow across the strings, and the sound joined the chaotic symphony of the club.

It wasn't just music. It was existence.

Taro stood there, the only "Normal" person in a room of monsters and gods. The patch on his neck was cold.

"Your turn, new guy!"

A massive figure—literally a walking amplifier with limbs—slapped Taro on the back. "Don't be shy! Drop the mask! Spike as hard as you want!"

Taro hesitated.

Could he?

He had spent his whole life terrified of his own resonance. Terrified that he was broken. Terrified that if he let go, he would crash the system. But there was no system here. Just the Null.

He closed his eyes. He focused on the itch in his brain. The pressure behind his eyes. The wrongness. <em>Let it out.</em> He gritted his teeth and pushed.

Immediately, the collar around his neck woke up. <em>WARNING: UNAUTHORIZED_OSCILLATION.</em> Correctional discharge initiated, the system delivering a max-level shock therapy of 150V. SDI: 0.98, HIQ: 0.95. Phase Drift Coefficient: 0.12. Score Units: 140 SU.

<em>ZAP.</em> A bolt of white-hot agony shot into his spine. Taro fell to his knees, gasping. The Voss-Link was doing its job—punishing deviation with electricity.

"Don't fight it!" the Amplifier-Guy shouted. "If the collar triggers, it'll fry your cortex!"

Taro smelled burning skin. The pain was blinding. The System was telling him to stop. To stay flat. But the "Wrongness" inside him... it didn't shrink from the pain.

It hissed. It was hungry. Taro felt the Void in his chest turn toward the collar. It drank the electricity. It swallowed the shock. <em>ENERGY_DRAIN_DETECTED.</em> An internal sink was absorbing the correctional discharge, the external load failing completely.

The collar whined, then died with a sharp click.

Taro stood up. The pain was gone. The only thing left was the silence.

The "Cadet Taro" hull peeled away like wet paper.

He opened his eyes. He looked down at his hands. They weren't blue wireframe anymore. They were... <em>Void.</em> They were black. Absolutes. Holes in reality where the light fell in and didn't come out.

He looked at his reflection in the polished metal of a nearby pillar. He wasn't a geometric shape. He wasn't a storm cloud. He wasn't neon glass. He was a silhouette. A shadow. A walking absence of data.

The music around him faltered. People stopped dancing. They stared at the figure standing in the center of the room—a figure that looked like a tear in the universe.

"Whoa," the Amplifier-Guy whispered, backing away. "That's... that's deep code, man."

Taro looked at Elara. She had stopped playing. She was hovering in the air, her glass wings beating slowly. She looked at him with awe, not fear.

"The Void," she whispered. "You're not dissonant, Taro."

She drifted closer, her light reflecting off his darkness.

"You're the Silence."

Taro panicked. <em>Silence.</em> The enemy. The monsters that ate the city.

"No," he gasped, trying to pull the mask back on. "No, I'm not... I'm not one of them!"

"Not them," Elara said firmly. She reached out and took his hand. Her light didn't disappear into his darkness; it swirled around it, creating a beautiful, high-contrast event horizon. "You're a Full-Spectrum-Killer, Taro. The Silence destroys. You... you absorb. You're a living damping field."

She smiled, her glass face glowing in the dark.

"You're not a wrong note, Taro. You're the rest between the measures. The perfect gap in the signal that gives the music meaning."

Taro stared at his black hands. The "Void" wasn't chaos. It was peace. It was the only quiet thing in a world of noise.

For the first time in his life, he didn't feel broken.

He felt necessary.

Taro reached up and touched the dead collar around his neck. It was cold. Lifeless. Just a piece of plastic now.

He thought of the apartment in Sector 7. The red text on his HUD. <em>THREAT_LEVEL: ELEVATED.</em> Proximity lock was established, targeting the very place he called home.

"Mom," he whispered to the dark.

He clenched his fist. The Void rippled around his fingers, eager. Waiting. "I'm coming for you."

He looked at Elara. He looked at the crowd of wrong notes.

"And I'm bringing the noise."
