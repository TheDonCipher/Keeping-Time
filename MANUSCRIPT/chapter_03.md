### [20:01:15] THE DEAD ZONE

Taro stood outside the apartment door.

The air in Sector 7-C was thick with what the manual called **Analog Interference**. To the naked eye, the hallway was just dim and dirty. To a user with an active Neural-Acoustic Interface, it was a sandstorm. Stray radio waves, unshielded power coupling hums, and the jagged, packet-loss chatter of cheap hardware cluttered the bandwidth.

**> ENVIRONMENT_WARNING:**
**> TYPE: POOR_CONNECTION**
**> LATENCY: 150ms**

Taro tapped his fingers against his thigh. *Tap. Tap. Tap.* 

It was a somatic calibration loop. A way to force his internal clock to sync when the external server was lagging. Every tap was a micro-handshake with his own biology, trying to clear the buffer of the day's static.

"Just get the bag," he whispered, his voice catching on the jitter. "Get... get out. Switch to low-power mode."

He palmed the lock. It was a Generation-1 contact plate, corroded and slow. It buzzed against his skin—a dirty, sawtooth vibration that indicated worn-out condensers—and slid open.

The apartment was worse than the hallway.
It was silent.
But not the "White Room" silence of high-end damping. This was **Suppressed Silence**.

**> AMBIENT_SCAN:**
**> DAMPING_FIELD: LOCAL_OVERRIDE**
**> STATUS: ARTIFICIAL**

Kael Nishimura sat at the kitchen table.

To Taro's sensor suite, his father looked... rendered.
In a zone defined by static and grit, Kael was a perfect, anti-aliased object. He didn't move. He didn't vibrate. He sat in a pool of perfect stillness, polishing his tuning fork with a microfiber cloth.

**> TARGET: KAEL_NISHIMURA**
**> CLASS: FUNDAMENTAL**
**> WAVEFORM: PURE_SINE**

Zero variance.
Kael was a living reference tone. He was so stable that the chaotic air of the slums seemed to break against him like water against a rock.

"You're back," Kael said. His voice was a perfect, uncompressed sine wave. No decay. No grit.

Taro stepped inside. Immediately, the **Impedance Mismatch** hit him. 

Taro's internal signal—a high-pressure, sawtooth oscillation—slammed into the dense, heavy atmosphere Kael was projecting. It felt like walking into a wall of solid gold.

The air between them shimmered. A visual artifact caused by two incompatible physics engines trying to occupy the same space. The Score flickered, unable to reconcile the two signals.

"Voss called," Kael said. He didn't look up.

"He gave me a choice," Taro said.

“No, he didn’t." Kael finally looked up. His eyes were tired, but his signal remained absolute. "He gave you a deployment order."

Taro sat down opposite him. The table vibrated. Taro’s leg was bouncing, a nervous tic that the System tagged as **> MOTOR_LOOP: UNSTABLE**.

"I have to go to Malkuth," Taro said.

"I know." Kael set the fork down. It made a perfect *ting*.
A single, pure Note. The Reference Pitch.
Taro's vision flared green. The note was so mathematically perfect it hurt to process.

"I tried to keep you in the middle, Taro," Kael said softly. "The Reference Pitch. It's safe. It's stable. It's Hi-Fi. It’s... home."

"It's too quiet, Dad. It hurts. My gain is too high for this room."

"It's quiet because I keep the noise out! I dump the heat so you don't have to!"

Kael’s amplitude spiked.
**> ALERT: PRESSURE_WAVE_DETECTED**
**> MAGNITUDE: 85dB**

For a second, the apartment's Damping Field buckled. Taro saw the raw power underneath his father's skin. Kael wasn't just a Calibrator; he was a Fundamental. A living anchor. He could overwrite the reality of the room in a microsecond if he chose to unclench his will.

But he didn't. He clamped it down.
**> STATUS: CONTAINED.**

"Your mother," Kael whispered. "She was loud too. She burned so bright she couldn't hold her form."

**> QUERY: AYANE_NISHIMURA**
**> ERROR: FILE_CORRUPTED**

Taro's HUD tried to pull the file, but the System returned only static.

"I'm not her," Taro said, his voice fragmenting. "I'm... I'm just me. I'm just a glitch."

"You have her frequency. The Fifth Harmonic. Unfiltered. Broadband." Kael looked at Taro’s neck, at the silver collar Voss had installed. "And now you have a leash. A damping band for your soul."

"It's not a leash. It's a limiter. So I don't... crash. So I don't peak and take the sector down."

"It's a muzzle."

Kael stood up. He walked to the reinforced cabinet in the corner. He pressed his hand to the scanner.
**> BIOMETRIC_MATCH: CONFIRMED.**

He pulled out a heavy, lead-lined case.

"She built this," Kael said, sliding it across the table. "For when you were older. Or for... this."

Taro opened it.
Inside was a set of headphones.
But not standard NAI-compatible gear. These were **Vintage Analog**. Heavy foam earcups. Braided copper cabling. Zero wireless chips. Zero smart-link integration.

"Pure Analog," Kael said. "No handshake. No System. Just... physics."

Taro picked them up. They felt heavy. Cold. Real.
**> OBJECT_ANALYSIS: UNKNOWN_TECH**
**> CONNECTIVITY: NONE**

"Put them on," Kael said.

Taro slid them over his ears. The heavy foam sealed tight against his skull.
He plugged the jack into his NAI's auxiliary port.

*Click.*

**> AUDIO_PROTOCOL: BYPASS**
**> INPUT_SOURCE: ANALOG_DIRECT**

Silence.
But not the "White Room" dead silence.
This was warm silence. The sound of blood rushing in the inner ear. The low-fidelity hum of copper wire waiting for a current.
The static of the Zone vanished. The crushing pressure of his father’s perfection vanished.
It was just Taro.

"She wanted you to hear yourself," Kael said. Taro heard the voice through bone conduction, muffled but distinct. "Without the System. Without the Code. Without the C-Order's compression algorithms."

Taro closed his eyes. 

For the first time all day, the data stream cut out. Total signal loss. 

No red error flags. No latency warnings. No pressure metrics. 

Just the dark. And a low, steady thrum in his chest. 

The Sawtooth Oscillation. 

It wasn't a glitch. It wasn't a buffer overflow. 

It was a song. A raw, high-resolution sample of his own existence.

Taro opened his eyes.
His father was looking at him.
The data tags were gone. Taro couldn't read Kael's biometrics. He couldn't see the threat level.
He just saw his dad. Looking sad.

"Thank you," Taro said.

"Go," Kael said, turning away. "Go before the feedback starts."

He was right. Taro could feel the pressure building in the room again. The physics of the two opposing waveforms demanding resolution. He couldn't stay. He was a volatile reaction in a stable solution.

Taro stood up. He generated a route to the terminal.
**> ROUTE_SET: ACADEMY_TERMINAL**

He walked to the door.

"Dad?"

"Yeah."

"Your signal," Taro said, his hand on the knob. "It's perfect."

"I know," Kael whispered. "That's the problem."

Taro opened the door and stepped out into the chaotic noise of the hallway.
The System booted back up.
**> SYSTEM: ONLINE**

Taro adjusted the analog headphones around his neck.
His dad was a pure sine wave. Perfect. Unchanging.
But the world wasn't a sine wave.
The world was noise.

And Taro was going to play it.
