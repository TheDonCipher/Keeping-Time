### [14:30:00] MIL-SPEC

The Combat Sim didn't look like the rest of the Academy.
To save processing power for physics calculations, the server stripped the textures. The walls were untextured gray polygons. The lighting was flat white.

**> GRAPHICS_SETTING: PERFORMANCE**
**> FRAMERATE: MAX**

"Simulation Alpha," the announcer's voice boomed. "Nishimura vs. Staccato."

Taro stood in the center of the arena. His danger sense was already redlining.

**> OPPONENT_SCAN:**
**> ID: MARCUS_STACCATO [YEAR 2]**
**> CLASS: RHYTHM_OPERATOR**
**> FACTION: G_VANGUARD**
**> THREAT_LEVEL: SEVERE**

Marcus didn't look like a student. He looked like hardware. He was a [[Rhythm Operator::An anti-personnel specialist who uses high-speed percussive strikes to disrupt an opponent's internal clock and force a combat 'Reset'.]] .
He wore the standard Vanguard carapace armor, but his was customized. Matte black. No reflections.
And his aura?
Taro's high-capacity eyes couldn't read it.

**> SCAN_RESULT: ERROR**
**> ENCRYPTION: MIL-SPEC [CLASS 4]**

He was running a jammer. To the System, he was a black hole in the data stream. A void where information should be.

"You're the Variable," Marcus said. His voice was choppy, percussive, every syllable landing on a perfect 16th-note sub-beat. "The Glitch. The Low-Fi sediment from Sector 7."

He didn't walk. He *ticked* forward, his movement locked to the simulation's master clock.

*Step. Step. Step.*

Every footfall was perfectly timed to a 140 BPM clock.
Taro's HUD tried to draw a predictive path for him, but the line kept snapping.

**> PREDICTION_ALGORITHM: FAILED**

"Voss says you have potential," Marcus said, his eyes scanning Taro with a zero-latency gaze. "Analysis: You have slop. You’re dropping frames in your footwork. You’re a jittery mess."

*CLICK.*

The baton extended. A glowing red tuning fork at the tip.
**> WEAPON_ID: TEMPO_ROD**
**> PITCH: SUSTAINED_MID**

"Begin," the announcer said.

Marcus vanished.

**> VISUAL_ARTIFACT: FRAME_SKIP**

One second he was ten meters away. The next frame, he was in Taro's face.
The proximity alarm shrieked.

**> ALERT: COLLISION_IMMINENT**

*CRACK.*

The baton hit Taro's ribs.
It wasn't just a kinetic impact. It was a **Downbeat**.
The resonance of the rod forced Taro's entire nervous system to reset its cycle. His lungs froze. His vision greyscaled.

**> STATUS: STUNNED**
**> CAUSE: FORCED_RESET**

Taro stumbled back, gasping. "How..."

"You operate on analog time," Marcus said, circling him with a high-capacity fluidity that made Taro’s head ache. "I operate on Grid Time. I am moving between your legacy refresh rate. You’re lagging, Glitch. I’m already in the next pulse."

He was right. 

To Taro's eyes, Marcus was glitching—not because Marcus was broken, but because Taro’s brain couldn't keep up with the frame-rate. Marcus appeared in flashes. Strobe-effect movement. He was exploiting the latency of Taro's own NAI-wetware handshake.

"Fight back," he ordered.

Taro gritted his teeth.
*Ignore the visuals. Focus on the hum.*
He pulled on the Variable Oscillation. He didn't try to clamp it this time. He let it scream.

**> OUTPUT: 80%**
**> TOPOLOGY: SAWTOOTH_BURST**

Taro threw a wave of jagged noise at him. A wide cone of distortion. You couldn't dodge it.

Marcus didn't dodge.
He *parried* the sound.

He swung his baton in a perfect vertical arc. The red tip cut through Taro's yellow wave like a hot knife through styrofoam.

**> INTERFERENCE: DESTRUCTIVE**
**> ATTACK: NULLIFIED**

The wave dissolved into harmless static. It was [[Destructive Interference::The phenomenon where two waves of equal frequency and opposite phase collide, resulting in instant silence. A perfect parry.]] .
Marcus stepped through the dissipating sparks.

"Sloppy," he said, his voice a flat, percussive disappointment. "High amplitude. Zero structure. You're just shouting into a dead air. You’re all gain, no resolution."

He raised the baton, the red tip humming at a perfect, lethal Mid-Pitch. 

"This is how you speak. This is high-fidelity combat."

He tapped the air.
*Click-click-click.*
Three rapid strikes. A triplet pattern.

The air solidified. The sound waves he created didn't dissipate; they hung in the air, forming a physical cage of red light around Taro.

**> TRAP_DETECTED: RHYTHM_CAGE**
**> STATUS: CONTAINED**

"End of simulation," Marcus said.

He tapped the cage.
*PING.*

The resonance collapsed inward.
It hit Taro from all sides.
His vision turned static.
His sound output flatlined.

**> CRITICAL_FAILURE**
**> SYSTEM_REBOOTING...**

Taro was on the floor. Groaning.
Marcus stood over him. He deactivated his jammer for one second.
Taro saw his true stats.

**> SYNC: 99.9%**
**> EFFICIENCY: 100%**
**> RECOVERY_RATE: OPTIMAL**
**> MOOD: BOREDOM [HI-FI]**

"Get a metronome, Glitch," he said, holstering his rod with a click that sounded like a hardware update. "Or don't come back. You're just noise in my signal path."

He walked away.
*Step. Step. Step.*
Perfect 140 BPM.

Taro lay there, watching the red "DEFEAT" banner burn into his retinas.
Ven and Hana were running toward him from the sidelines.
But Taro wasn't looking at them.
He was reviewing the replay buffer in his mind.

He didn't lose because he was weak.
He lost because he tried to drown a fish. Marcus didn't fight the wave; he swam through it.
