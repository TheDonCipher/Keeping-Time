### [14:30:00] MIL-SPEC

The Combat Sim didn't look like the rest of the Academy.
To save processing power for physics calculations, the server stripped the textures. The walls were untextured gray polygons. The lighting was flat white.

**> GRAPHICS_SETTING: PERFORMANCE**
**> FRAMERATE: MAX**

"Simulation Alpha," the announcer's voice boomed. "Nishimura vs. Staccato."

Taro stood in the center of the arena. His danger sense was already redlining.

**> OPPONENT_SCAN:**
**> ID: MARCUS_STACCATO [YEAR 2]**
**> CLASS: RHYTHM_OPERATOR**
**> FACTION: G_VANGUARD**
**> THREAT_LEVEL: SEVERE**

Marcus didn't look like a student. He looked like hardware.
He wore the standard Vanguard carapace armor, but his was customized. Matte black. No reflections.
And his aura?
Taro's high-bandwidth eyes couldn't read it.

**> SCAN_RESULT: ERROR**
**> ENCRYPTION: MIL-SPEC [CLASS 4]**

He was running a jammer. To the System, he was a black hole in the data stream. A void where information should be.

"You're the Variable," Marcus said. His voice was choppy. Percussive. "The Glitch."
He didn't walk. He *ticked* forward.

*Step. Step. Step.*

Every footfall was perfectly timed to a 140 BPM clock.
Taro's HUD tried to draw a predictive path for him, but the line kept snapping.

**> PREDICTION_ALGORITHM: FAILED**

"Voss says you have potential," Marcus said. He pulled a baton from his belt. "I say you have slop."

*CLICK.*

The baton extended. A glowing red tuning fork at the tip.
**> WEAPON_ID: TEMPO_ROD**
**> FREQUENCY: 300 Hz**

"Begin," the announcer said.

Marcus vanished.

**> VISUAL_ARTIFACT: FRAME_SKIP**

One second he was ten meters away. The next frame, he was in Taro's face.
The proximity alarm shrieked.

**> ALERT: COLLISION_IMMINENT**

*CRACK.*

The baton hit Taro's ribs.
It wasn't just a kinetic impact. It was a **Downbeat**.
The resonance of the rod forced Taro's entire nervous system to reset its cycle. His lungs froze. His vision greyscaled.

**> STATUS: STUNNED**
**> CAUSE: FORCED_RESET**

Taro stumbled back, gasping. "How..."

"You operate on analog time," Marcus said, circling him. "I operate on Grid Time. I am moving between your refresh rate."

He was right.
To Taro's eyes, Marcus was glitching. He appeared in flashes. Strobe-effect movement.
He was exploiting the latency of Taro's own brain.

"Fight back," he ordered.

Taro gritted his teeth.
*Ignore the visuals. Focus on the hum.*
He pulled on the Variable Oscillation. He didn't try to clamp it this time. He let it scream.

**> OUTPUT: 80%**
**> TOPOLOGY: SAWTOOTH_BURST**

Taro threw a wave of jagged noise at him. A wide cone of distortion. You couldn't dodge it.

Marcus didn't dodge.
He *parried* the sound.

He swung his baton in a perfect vertical arc. The red tip cut through Taro's yellow wave like a hot knife through styrofoam.

**> INTERFERENCE: DESTRUCTIVE**
**> ATTACK: NULLIFIED**

The wave dissolved into harmless static.
Marcus stepped through the dissipating sparks.

"Sloppy," he said. "High amplitude. Zero structure. You're just shouting."

He raised the baton.
"This is how you speak."

He tapped the air.
*Click-click-click.*
Three rapid strikes. A triplet pattern.

The air solidified. The sound waves he created didn't dissipate; they hung in the air, forming a physical cage of red light around Taro.

**> TRAP_DETECTED: RHYTHM_CAGE**
**> STATUS: CONTAINED**

"End of simulation," Marcus said.

He tapped the cage.
*PING.*

The resonance collapsed inward.
It hit Taro from all sides.
His vision turned static.
His sound output flatlined.

**> CRITICAL_FAILURE**
**> SYSTEM_REBOOTING...**

Taro was on the floor. Groaning.
Marcus stood over him. He deactivated his jammer for one second.
Taro saw his true stats.

**> SYNC: 99%**
**> EFFICIENCY: 100%**
**> MOOD: BOREDOM**

"Get a metronome, Glitch," he said, holstering his rod. "Or don't come back."

He walked away.
*Step. Step. Step.*
Perfect 140 BPM.

Taro lay there, watching the red "DEFEAT" banner burn into his retinas.
Ven and Hana were running toward him from the sidelines.
But Taro wasn't looking at them.
He was reviewing the replay buffer in his mind.

He didn't lose because he was weak.
He lost because he tried to drown a fish. Marcus didn't fight the wave; he swam through it.
