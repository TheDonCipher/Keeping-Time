### [00:00:00] THE ZAP

It hits you like a nail gun to the base of the skull. 

White light. Static. The taste of copper and burning hair. 

For a microsecond, you aren't human. You aren't Taro Nishimura. You are just a node trying to handshake with a network that is infinitely larger than you. Your nervous system shrieks as the Neural-Acoustic Interface (NAI) overrides your optic nerve, forcing a new operating system onto your wetware. The local server is rejecting your presence; your heartbeat is lagging, and your pulses are dropping frames before they even hit your nerves.

Then, the crash.

Your vision reboots. The world snaps back, but it hasn't just returned. It has been *rewritten*.

**> PERCEPTION: ONLINE**
**> SENSATION: PRESSURE [110 BPM]**

I blinked, but the data wasn't floating in front of me. It was burned into the world itself. The text wasn't a screen overlay; it was a hallucination carved into the walls.

*Breathe,* I told myself. *Sync the clock.*

My heartbeat thumped against my ribs, but I didn't just feel it. I saw it—a jagged yellow line pulsing in the corner of my eye.

I stood in the staff locker room of Sector 7-C Calibration Hall. To a Normal—someone without a chip—it was just a room with gray lockers and a flickering fluorescent light.

To me? It was a data stream.

The light fixture wasn't just flickering; it tasted like sour milk—a dirty **60 Hz Hum** bleeding into the air. The lockers hummed with the **Resonance: Steel**, vibrating against my teeth even though I wasn't touching them.

And the door...

The door was a wall of red static.

**> INTUITION: LOCKED**
**> KEY: 261.63 HZ**

I swiped my wristband—three heavy damping cuffs locked over the pulse point—across the sensor.

*Beep.*

**> SENSATION: UNLOCKED**

The red static shattered into green particles, and the door slid open.

I stepped out onto the floor.

### [00:14:32] THE FLOOR

The main calibration floor was a cathedral of data.

It opened up into a massive, circular chamber. The air here smelled scrubbed, filtered to a perfect, sterile transparency. But my head... my head was screaming.

**> AMBIENT: 261.63 HZ [MIDDLE C]**
**> SENSATION: GOLDEN_SYRUP**

The room didn't just sound like Middle C; it *felt* like it.

A massive, golden sine wave floated through the center of the room—not a projection, but a shared hallucination enforced by The Score. It was beautiful. Perfect. Boring.

It rolled through the air, touching everything. When it passed through the technicians working at their stations, I felt their calmness as a soft, green warmth. **SYNCED**.

I kept my head down. My own signal felt like a scratch in my throat—a nervous, jagged **ORANGE WARNING**.

**> USER_FREQ: 880 Hz [SUPPRESSED]**
**> PRESSURE: CRITICAL**

"Hey, Glitch."

I didn't need to look up. The air suddenly smelled like bubblegum and ozone.

**> ID: REMI_SATO [APP_CALIBRATOR]**
**> KEY: D MAJOR [PLAYFUL]**

Remi hopped over the railing. To my synesthetic eyes, she was surrounded by a faint, bubbly blue distortion. D Major. Happy. Bright.

"You're leaking," she said, pointing at my head.

I touched my temple. No blood.

"You're leaking signal," she clarified. "I can taste the fuzz on your edges. Your bandwidth is too wide for these standard damping bands. They're already hitting thermal limit."

I glanced at my wrist. The three bands weren't just warm; they were glowing faint red in my thermal vision. 

**> HEAT_SINK: 60% CAPACITY**
**> LOAD_WARNING: PEAKING**

"Bad night," I muttered. "My... my hardware feels like it's grinding. Too much jitter in the sector."

"You need to dump heat," Remi said, walking alongside me. Her footsteps left little ripple-rings of blue light on the floor. "You can't keep bottling an 880 signal. It’s like trying to hold a live wire with wet hands. You're gonna peak and take the whole floor with you."

"It's not a grenade," I said. "It's just hardware noise. High-latency artifacts."

"It's incredible," she corrected. "If you'd just let the system index it—"

**[PAIN] [PAIN] [PAIN]**

My vision flared red. It wasn't a popup window. It was a migraine that slammed into my frontal lobe.

**> PRIORITY_OVERRIDE**
**> SENSATION: ROTTING_MEAT**
**> EVENT: CASUALTY_INCOMING**

The emergency doors at the far end of the hall blasted open.

### [00:14:45] THE CRASH

He came in like a corrupted file.

A G Vanguard soldier. Stumbling. Screaming.

But through The Score, he was a catastrophe.

His avatar was pixelating, tearing apart in real-time. Where a normal person had a smooth bio-plasma aura, this guy was a storm of black and purple static. It smelled like burning plastic.

**> ERROR: SIGNAL_FRAG**
**> SENSATION: NAUSEA**

The golden sine wave of the room’s Middle C hit him—and shattered.

Visually, it looked like glass breaking. The soldier’s chaotic field smashed into the perfection of the hall, sending shards of virtual gold flying everywhere. The technicians nearest him fell to their knees, clutching their heads as the interference hit them like a physical blow.

"Get the dampeners!" Remi shouted, her blue D Major aura spiking into a sharp, fearful indigo.

I froze.

My brain was trying to process the data, but it was too fast.

**> INTUITION: CHAOS**
**> TARGET_FREQ: OSCILLATING [196Hz - 330Hz]**

The soldier collapsed in the center of the room. He was convulsing. His NAI port on his neck was sparking—real sparks, not AR—and the data pouring out of him was raw code. I could taste the metal of his agony.

*Help me. End it. Silence.*

The Calibration team rushed in with stabilizers—big, bulky pylons designed to force a signal reset. They slammed them into the floor.

*Thoom.*

A blue containment field sprang up.

**> SENSATION: PRESSURE_DROP**

It wasn't enough. The soldier’s static ate through the blue wall like acid. The field flickered, grayed out, and collapsed.

He let out a sound—a physical scream that hit the microphone limiters in my ears.

**[AUDIO_CLIPPING]**

My damping bands got hot. Really hot.

**> HEAT_SINK: 95%**
**> WARNING: CONTAINMENT_BREACH**

I felt the 880 Hz inside me waking up. It didn't care about the soldier. It didn't care about Remi.

It saw the chaos. It saw the broken code. And it wanted to *fix* it.

*Don't,* I thought. *Stay clamped.*

But the soldier’s field spiked. A massive wave of purple distortion rolled toward us. Remi threw her hands up, her little D Major shield buckling instantly.

She was going to get wiped. Blue-screened.

**> LOGIC_FAILURE**
**> EMOTIONAL_OVERRIDE**

My hand moved on its own.

I reached out.

The three damping bands on my wrist didn't just fail; they slagged. In The Score, I saw them turn white-hot and effectively vaporize from the data load.

**> LIMITER: REMOVED**
**> SENSATION: FREE_FALL**

The world slowed down. Frame-rate drop.

I saw the soldier’s waveform coming at me—a jagged, ugly mess of jagged peaks.

And I saw the solution.

It was a math problem. He was missing a variable. He was trying to resolve a chord without the tonic.

I gave it to him.

I didn't scream. I didn't shout. I pulsed.

**> EXECUTE: OCTAVE_JUMP**
**> SOURCE: 440 Hz**
**> TARGET: 880 Hz [DOUBLE]**

A massive, vertical pillar of Gold light erupted from my hand. It looked like a god-ray striking the earth. Solid. Infinite. Absolute. A pure sine-wave strike that overrode the local key signature.

**> INTERFERENCE: CONSTRUCTIVE**
**> AMPLITUDE: MAX [OVERFLOW]**
**> OUTPUT: 4.2 MILLION JOULES**

For one single frame of animation, we synced. His chaos locked into my order. The purple static aligned into a perfect, terrifying geometric pattern.

Then, the math broke.

**> SENSATION: INTEGER_OVERFLOW**

The numbers got too big. My brain couldn't render the magnitude.

*CRACK.*

The soldier’s bio-plasma field didn't stabilize. It didn't dampen. It *popped*. 

Like a balloon. One second, he was a storm of data. The next, he was just... a guy. A bricked unit. Lying on the floor. His NAI dark. His aura gone.

**> TARGET: OFFLINE**
**> SENSATION: NULL**

Silence. 

Real silence. No hum. No Middle C. No data.

I stood there, my hand still outstretched. Smoke was rising from my wrist where the bands used to be. My bandwidth was still pegged, the raw signal screaming in the dead air.

My vision was flickering. Glitching.

**> DIAGNOSTIC: BASELINE_ALTERED**
**> NEW_USER_ID: DETECTED [AUTHORITY_NULL]**

I looked at my hand. In The Score, it wasn't a hand anymore.

It was a burning torch of 880 Hz code, rewriting the air around it.

Remi was staring at me. Or rather, staring at the space *above* me.

I looked up.

Floating above my head, where a normal ID tag should be, was a new symbol. It wasn't a Shield. It wasn't a Tuning Fork. 

It was a Crown.

**> WARNING: VANGUARD_CLASS_DETECTED**
**> STATUS: HIGH_FIDELITY_THREAT**

The text burned into my retina. Once. Twice.

Then the world went black. 

**> SYSTEM_CRASH [UNRECOVERABLE]**
