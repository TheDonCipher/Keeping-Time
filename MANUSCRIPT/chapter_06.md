### [10:05:00] THE HEAT SINK

Steam hissed from the cervical vents in Ven's armor.

They were deep underground, in the Academy's **Grounding Vault**. The walls here were thick concrete, lined with heavy copper bus-bars designed to absorb excess resonant energy. The air was heavy, tasting of wet iron and ozone.

**> UNIT_STATUS: VEN_CALIBRATOR**
**> THERMAL_LOAD: 98% [CRITICAL]**
**> CAPACITY: MAX_LOAD**

Ven sat on a concrete bench. He didn't look in pain. He looked deeply, heavily asleep. His eyes were half-lidded, his breathing slow and tectonic.

Taro checked the telemetry.
**> INTERNAL_CORE_TEMP: 104°F**
**> COOLANT_LOOP: ACTIVE**

"You okay?" Taro asked.

Ven exhaled. A visible ripple of heat distortion left his mouth, blurring the air in front of him.
"I'm full," Ven rumbled. Even his whisper utilized sub-bass frequencies that shook dust from the ceiling types. "That input spike... it was pure."

He tapped his heavy metal gauntlets against the copper wall-plate.
*CLANG.*

**> PROTOCOL: GROUNDING_DISCHARGE**
**> RATE: 500 WATTS**

White sparks flew from his knuckles. Ven was literally dumping the resonant energy Taro had pumped into him back into the building's electrical grid. The lights in the hallway flickered brighter as the surge hit the mains.

"Sorry," Taro said. "I didn't mean to overload you."

"You didn't overload me," Ven corrected. "You *filled* me. There's a difference."

He looked at Taro. His pupils were dilated, sluggish.
**> BIOMETRIC_READ: RELIEF**

"Most people... their noise is dirty," Ven said. "Hana's signal is sharp. It cuts. The Vanguard students are jagged. When I absorb them, it feels like swallowing broken glass."

He groaned as another wave of excess heat vented from his suit's exhaust ports.

"But your Variable Oscillation," Ven murmured. "It's clean. It's just... raw power. No agenda. No politics. Just 'I am here.'"

"It breaks things," Taro said. "I break things."

"You only break things because you have nowhere to put the energy. You're a generator with no cable."

Ven reached out. His hand was massive, encased in a limiter gauntlet.
He offered it to Taro.

**> INTERACTION_PROMPT: HARDLINE_LINK**
**> TYPE: GROUND_CIRCUIT**

"I have mass," Ven said. "I have capacity. You have output."

"I might fry you."

"Try me."

Taro hesitated. His internal warnings were screaming about **Impedance Mismatch** and **High Voltage**.
But he remembered the Sandbox. He remembered the feeling of the pressure valve opening.

Taro reached out and grabbed Ven's hand.

*THUD.*

No sparks. No lightning.
Just a heavy, solid mechanical lock.
Like a seatbelt clicking into place.

**> CIRCUIT: CLOSED**
**> FLOW_DIRECTION: TARO -> VEN**
**> STABILITY: 99%**

The pressure in Taro's head—the constant buzzing of the variable oscillation—drained away instantly. It flowed out of his arm and into Ven's infinite capacity.
Ven took a deep breath. His thermal vents glowed a soft, steady orange.

"See?" Ven smiled. It was the first time he looked fully awake. "I can take it. All of it."

**> NEW_TOPOLOGY: THE_GROUND_WIRE**
**> SYNERGY_BONUS: STABILITY_INCREASE**

"We need Hana," Ven said, not letting go. "She aims. You shoot. I hold the gun."

Reforged.
Taro looked at the data. Square Wave, Sawtooth, and Sine Sink.
It wasn't a standard C-Major triad. It was a new circuit design. Something dangerous.

But for the first time since the Zap...
**> SYSTEM_STATUS: STABLE.**
