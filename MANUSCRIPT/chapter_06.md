### [10:05:00] THE HEAT SINK

Steam hissed from the cervical vents in Ven's armor.

They were deep underground, in the Academy's **Grounding Vault**. The walls here were thick concrete, lined with heavy copper bus-bars designed to absorb excess resonant energy. The air was heavy, tasting of wet iron and ozone.

**> UNIT_STATUS: VEN_CALIBRATOR**
**> THERMAL_LOAD: 98% [CRITICAL]**
**> CAPACITY: MAX_LOAD**

Ven sat on a concrete bench. He didn't look in pain, but his biometrics were screaming. He looked deeply, heavily asleep, his internal CPU struggling to process the massive packet-burst Taro had dumped into his system. His eyes were half-lidded, his breathing a slow, tectonic 40 BPM.

Taro checked the telemetry.
**> INTERNAL_CORE_TEMP: 104°F**
**> COOLANT_LOOP: ACTIVE**

"You okay?" Taro asked.

Ven exhaled. A visible ripple of heat distortion left his mouth, blurring the air in front of him.
"I'm full," Ven rumbled. Even his whisper utilized sub-bass frequencies that shook dust from the ceiling types. "That input spike... it was pure."

He tapped his heavy metal gauntlets against the copper wall-plate.
*CLANG.*

**> PROTOCOL: GROUNDING_DISCHARGE**
**> RATE: 500 WATTS**

White sparks flew from his knuckles. Ven was literally dumping the resonant energy Taro had pumped into him back into the building's electrical grid. The lights in the hallway flickered brighter as the surge hit the mains.

"Sorry," Taro said, his voice fragmenting. "I didn't mean to... to peak like that. I didn't mean to overload your buffer."

"You didn't overload me," Ven corrected, his voice a rolling bass wave that made Taro’s teeth vibrate. "You *filled* me. My capacity is high-fidelity, Taro. Most people... they’re just low-bit noise."

He looked at Taro. His pupils were dilated, vibrating with a high-bandwidth afterimage. 

"Most people... their noise is dirty," Ven said. "Hana's signal is sharp. It’s a square-wave cut. The Vanguard students are jagged sawtooth types. When I absorb them, it feels like my hardware is grinding on sand."

He groaned as another wave of excess heat vented from his suit's exhaust ports, a visible thermal dump that clouded the room.

"But your Variable Oscillation," Ven murmured. "It's clean. It's broadband. No filters. Just 'I am here.' High-resolution existence."

"It breaks things," Taro said. "I'm... I'm a walks-around buffer overflow."

"You only break things because you have no hardline. You're a generator with no cable."

Ven reached out. His hand was massive, encased in a limiter gauntlet.
He offered it to Taro.

**> INTERACTION_PROMPT: HARDLINE_LINK**
**> TYPE: GROUND_CIRCUIT**

"I have mass," Ven said. "I have capacity. You have output."

"I might fry you."

"Try me."

Taro hesitated. His internal warnings were screaming about **Impedance Mismatch** and **High Voltage**.
But he remembered the Sandbox. He remembered the feeling of the pressure valve opening.

Taro reached out and grabbed Ven's hand.

*THUD.*

No sparks. No lightning.
Just a heavy, solid mechanical lock.
Like a seatbelt clicking into place.

**> CIRCUIT: CLOSED**
**> FLOW_DIRECTION: TARO -> VEN**
**> STABILITY: 99%**

The pressure in Taro's head—the constant buzzing of the variable oscillation—drained away instantly. It was like switching from a jittery analog signal to a clean digital stream. It flowed out of his arm and into Ven's infinite, low-impedance capacity. 

Ven took a deep breath. His thermal vents glowed a soft, steady orange. "Ah. Clean sample."

"See?" Ven smiled. It was the first time he looked fully awake, his voice gaining dynamic range. "My hardware can take it. All of it. I’m a broadband-sink, Taro. Use me."

**> NEW_TOPOLOGY: THE_GROUND_WIRE**
**> SYNERGY_BONUS: STABILITY_INCREASE [HI-FI]**

"We need Hana," Ven said, not letting go. "She aims. You shoot. I hold the gun."

Reforged.
Taro looked at the data. Square Wave, Sawtooth, and Sine Sink.
It wasn't a standard C-Major triad. It was a new circuit design. Something dangerous.

But for the first time since the Zap...
**> SYSTEM_STATUS: STABLE.**
