## Chapter 16: Illegal Modulations

### [05:00:00] THE CONVERSATION

"We call it modulating," Elara said. Her voice had a slight echo, a shimmering texture that indicated her Score port’s filters were partially disengaged. We were in Practice Room 404, a locked vault where unauthorized access had been successfully masked and monitoring was suppressed. The server was in its maintenance cycle, and the room's soundproofing was pushed to its maximum 120dB limit, ensuring an acoustic leakage of less than zero point zero zero one percent.

The cello lay forgotten on the floor. She was sitting cross-legged, the holographic interface floating between them. It was a hacking deck—a custom, jailbroken UI that glowed with an illegal, warm amber light. It looked like vintage analog gear shoved into a digital world. It was messy. It was Low-Fi. It was beautiful.

"Modulating," Taro repeated, his own voice fragmenting as he tried to match her tempo. "Like... changing your key signature?"

"Deeper," Elara said. She tapped a command. A waveform appeared in the air. It was ugly, jagged, and chaotic—a raw full-spectrum signal.

"This is me," she said, pointing to the chaos. "This is my raw resonance. My [[Factory Setting::The hardcoded frequency protocol assigned at birth, a digital cage that defines who you are before you've even learned to speak.]] . The system scans this at birth, says 'High Mass, Low-End Pitch,' and locks the Hull class. It ignores the sub-harmonics. It tells you to stay flat before you’ve even learned to sing."

She tapped another key. A second waveform appeared overlaid on top—smooth, sine-wave perfection.

"And this," she said, her voice dropping into a grainier, bit-crushed tone, "is the mask. The stabilizer algorithm. It forces my signal into a clean sine wave. It's an active noise-cancellation filter running 24/7 in my neck. It's Hi-Fi lies. It’s socially acceptable damping."

Taro stared at the graph. "That's why it hurts. You're constantly fighting your own output. Your hardware is redlining."

"It's like screaming with your mouth sewn shut," Elara whispered. "Every second of every day. Total signal suppression. You carry that load until you either clip or brick."

She looked at Taro. The vulnerability in her eyes was gone, replaced by a sharp, technical focus.

"But there's a workaround. A patch. Modulation."

She swiped her hand. The amber interface shifted. <em>EXECUTE: MODULATION_PROTOCOL.</em> An unauthorized frequency shift was requested, targeting a pitch shift of plus two octaves to hit 1.2 kHz. <em>WARNING: WARRANTY_VOID.</em> The security kernel was bypassed, the administrative alert neutralized. SDI: 0.95, HIQ: 0.88. Phase Drift Coefficient: 0.45.

It was illegal [[Modulation::The unauthorized modification of one's own soul, a crime against the Grand Concord's absolute order.]] .

"The System locks our resonance," Elara explained. "It says your pitch is fixed. Immutable. Biological destiny. Social hygiene." She scoffed. "But the Score is just software. And software can be cracked."

"You hacked your own Score port?" Taro asked, stunned. Tampering with a port was a one-way ticket to a reformatting ward.

"I didn't hack it," Elara said. "I bypassed the C-Order kernel. I wrote a custom driver that sits between my raw signal and the Hull output. It takes my jagged waveform and... translates it. Instead of forcing it down into a low-end sink, it lets it flow up. Into the treble range. High-fidelity self-determination. I can finally dump heat without clipping the whole sector."

She reached out and touched the holographic waveform. As her finger made contact, her hand flickered violently—phasing between the heavy glove and the light beneath.

*Wrong note.*

For a second, the heavy, gloved hand of "Cadet Kimura" vanished. In its place was the slender, radiant wireframe hand Taro had seen before. No textures. No hulls. Just the raw mesh.

"When I run the mod," Elara said softly, her voice now a clean, uncompressed treble, "the pain stops. The noise stops. I don't feel like I'm wearing a spacesuit made of lead. My latency drops to zero. I’m finally in sync with myself."

"Why don't you run it all the time?" Taro asked.

Elara laughed, a dark, humorless sound. She let go of the interface. The wireframe hand snapped back into the heavy glove.

"Because the C-Order has scanners," she said. "If the Gatekeepers detect a signal that doesn't match the Hull ID, they flag it as 'corruption.' They assume you're a virus. A wrong note. They drag you to the White Room and they reformat you. They turn you off."

Taro shuddered. He knew what reformatting meant. It was what Voss had tried to do to him. Erasing the person to save the code.

"So you hide," Taro said, his fingers tapping a slow 4/4 against his palm.

"We hide," Elara corrected. "There are others, Taro. Not many. But enough to make a chorus."

She looked at him, her eyes searching his face. 

"You said you saw the mesh," she said. "You saw me. Unfiltered."

"Yeah."

"What about you?" she asked. "What's your factory setting? What's your raw signal?"

Taro hesitated. He looked at his own hands. He thought about the crash. The Void. The way the "Corrected" world looked so broken to him now—like a low-res texture map over a dying server.

"I don't know," Taro admitted. "I was trying so hard to be hi-fi. To stay flat. To match the key signature."

"Masking," Elara nodded. "Damping your soul so you don't peak."

"But then I broke," Taro said. "And now... now I don't fit the key at all. My capacity is too wide. I'm dissonant. I'm noise."

"Noise is just data the system doesn't understand yet," Elara said. It sounded like a mantra. Something she had repeated to herself a thousand times in the dark. "It's unindexed beauty."

She leaned forward.

"You're not noise, Taro. You're just... unverified."

She tapped the amber console. A map appeared. It was a schematic of the city's lower levels—the infrastructure tunnels beneath the Academy.

"There's a place," she said. "Down in the Sub-Bass levels. A club. The Dead Zone. It's a Faraday cage. No system signal. No scanners. No C-Order updates. You can run as sharp as you want there."

She looked at him.

"We go there to run our mods. To be ourselves. Even if it's just for a few hours."

She offered him a small, data-chip. It was old tech—a physical drive, black and unmarked.

"If you ever want to see what you really look like," she said, "without the hull... come find us."

Taro took the chip. It felt warm. <em>ITEM_ACQUIRED: ENCRYPTED_KEY [DEAD_ZONE].</em> The acoustic signature was confirmed, targeting the sub-bass sector. My system flagged a crossroads, a neural variance threshold identified. A decision was required.

"Illegal modulation," he murmured, weighing the felony in his hand.

"Self-determination," Elara corrected. "Factory settings are a suggestion, Taro. You are the Architect."

Taro looked at the chip, then back at Elara. The "Tank" cadet was gone. He saw her now—really saw her. The wireframe shining through the cracks in the armor.

"I'll be there," Taro said.
