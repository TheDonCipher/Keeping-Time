### [18:00:00] THE GOLDEN FILTER

The dropship doors hissed open.

"Deployment in 3... 2... 1..."

They dropped.
Taro's HUD altimeter scrolled rapidly, his internal gyroscope compensating for the G-force.
**> ALTITUDE: 50m... 20m... TOUCHDOWN.**

They hit the pavement in formation. Hana took point. Ven took rear. Taro took the center.
The city of Sector 4 stretched out before them.

It was beautiful.
Too beautiful.

Through The Score, every building was sheathed in white marble and gold trim. The streets were clean. The people walked with a synchronized gait, their tags reading **> STATUS: CITIZEN [HAPPY]**.
The sky was a perfect, gradient blue.

"Sector 4 secured," Hana reported. Her voice was crisp. "Resonance levels stable at Reference Pitch."

**> REPUTATION_GAIN: +10**
**> MONITOR: VOSS [ACTIVE]**

Taro looked closer at the wall next to him.
His HUD tagged it: **> MATERIAL: POLISHED_MARBLE**.
But he heard a *hiss*.

His filter-agnostic eyes caught the flicker.
For one frame (1/60th of a second), the texture failed to load.
Beneath the white marble AR skin, the wall was actually crumbling concrete, covered in black mold. It smelled like wet rot.

**> GLITCH_DETECTED**
**> TEXTURE_FAILURE: 5%**

"It's a slum," Taro whispered.

"Maintain comms discipline," Hana said. She was walking down the center of the street, following a glowing green **Nav-Line** that pulled her forward like a magnet. To her, this place *was* a paradise. Her NAI blocked the smell of sewage. Her perception erased the homeless people sitting in the gutters, replacing them with generic street furniture or empty space.

**> MASKING_PROTOCOL: ACTIVE**

Taro looked at a man sitting against a dumpster.
To Hana, he was literally invisible. Her pathing algorithm walked her *around* him, but her brain didn't register his existence. He was "filtered noise."

But Taro saw him.
**> TARGET: UNREGISTERED_RESIDENT**
**> STATUS: STARVING**
**> HEALTH: CRITICAL**

The man looked up. He saw the Vanguard uniform. He didn't see a hero. He saw a boot.

"Taro," Ven rumbled. "Heart rate spike."
**> VEN_STATUS: CONCERNED**

"The filters," Taro said, tapping his temple. "They're painting over everything. This place is rotting, Ven."

"Don't look at it," Hana ordered. She stopped. "If it is not indexed by the C-Order, it is not relevant to the mission."

"It's people, Hana."

"It is Noise," she corrected. "And we are here to tune it."

She pointed to a structure ahead.
It was a **Resonance Node**—a massive tuning fork embedded in the street.
But in Taro's vision, it was surrounded by a cloud of black static.

**> ANOMALY_DETECTED**
**> SIGNAL_RETURN: NULL**
**> TYPE: UNKNOWN**

"You see that?" Taro asked.

Hana squinted.
**> SCANNING...**
**> ERROR: TARGET_NOT_FOUND**

"I see a standard Node," she said. "Reading nominal. Slight drift."

"No," Taro said. "Look at the shadows. The data isn't drifting. It's... missing."

Taro walked toward the Node.
The "Golden" AR texture peeled away like burnt skin.
The air got cold.
The 880 Hz hum—his constant companion—faltered.

It didn't glitch. It didn't buffer.
It just... stopped.

**> WARNING: SIGNAL_VOID**
**> DAMPING: EXTERNAL_SOURCE**

Taro reached out to touch the Node.
There was a symbol scratch-etched into the metal. It wasn't C-Order. It wasn't Vanguard.
It was an empty circle.

**> SYMBOL_ID: THE_SILENCE**

"Hana," Taro said, his voice dropping to a whisper. "We're not patrolling. We're hunting."

The shadows stretched.
And for the first time, The Score gave him no data at all.

**> ENEMY: [REDACTED]**
