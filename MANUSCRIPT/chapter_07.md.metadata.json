  "summary": "Immersive draft of Chapter 7. Scene introduces Marcus Staccato (G Vanguard). Set in the 'Live Fire' combat sim. Marcus is depicted as a 'Mil-Spec' machine—his UI is encrypted, his movements are Frame-Perfect. The chapter contrasts Taro's raw, glitchy power with Marcus's refined, military-grade rhythm. Taro loses the duel but learns the importance of 'Tempo' over 'Amplitude'.",
