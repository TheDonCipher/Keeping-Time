### [09:00:00] THE DEBUGGER

The world was blue.
Not the color of the sky, or the ocean, or any organic thing. It was the blue of a command line terminal. ` #0000FF`. Pure, mathematical, and cold.

Taro lay on a flat plane. It was labeled `[BED_MEDICAL_STD]`.
It had no texture. Just a white wireframe mesh defining its boundaries. He couldn't feel the sheets, only a variable called `PRESSURE` applied to his back.

"Input lag," a voice said. "Zero point four seconds."

Taro turned his head. The motion blurred, skipping frames.
A figure stood next to the bed.
It was a low-poly approximation of a human. Sharp triangular polygons formed the coat. The face was a blank geometric mask with two dark squares for eyes. A floating tag hovered above the head:

**> ID: ADJUTANT_VOSS**
**> CLASS: ADMIN**
**> THREAT: NULL**

"Voss?" Taro asked. His audio filters cracked. The name came out as `V-oss_ss_ss`.

"Stabilize your vocal drivers," the polygon-figure said. The voice was crisp, lacking any room reverb. In Safe Mode, acoustics weren't simulated. "You are running on emergency power, Taro. Don't try to render High-Fidelity emotions."

Voss tapped the air. A floating menu appeared—a simple list of white text on a black background.

**> OPEN_LOG: ACCIDENT_REPORT_440**
**> PLAYBACK SQUEEZED**

"I've been reviewing your crash dump," Voss said. He walked around the bed. His movement was jerky, snapping from one keyframe to the next without interpolation. "It is... impressive."

"I saw the sky," Taro rasped. "The real sky."

The polygon-Voss stopped.
"You saw nothing. You experienced a rendering failure. A graphic card crash. Your brain filled in the gaps with noise."

"It was white noise," Taro said. "It was... everything."

"It was chaos," Voss corrected. "And chaos is lethal."

Voss swiped a wireframe hand. A hologram appeared in the center of the room. It was a playback of the alleyway in Sector 4. Blocky, recorded data.
Taro watched himself—a glowing wireframe avatar—rip the limiter off his neck.
He watched the explosion of gold light.

**> ERROR: INTEGER_OVERFLOW**
**> OUTPUT: 3,000,000+ [INVALID]**

"Look at that number," Voss said, pointing a sharp finger at the floating text. "Three million. That shouldn't be possible. The human nervous system melts at ten thousand. You didn't just break the limiter, Taro. You broke the math."

Taro stared at the recording. "I didn't mean to."

"Intent is irrelevant. The compiler doesn't care if you 'meant' to cause a stack overflow. It only cares that the system crashed."
Voss closed the window. The room returned to sterile blue silence.

"The Council wants you deleted," Voss said calmly. "They see a bug. A critical vulnerability that could destabilize the entire grid. They think you are a walking kernel panic."

Taro felt a spike of `FEAR`. A simple red warning light in his peripheral vision.
"Are you going to kill me?"

The low-poly mask tilted.
"Kill? No. That is a waste of data."
Voss leaned in. His wireframe face was inches from Taro's.
"I don't delete bugs, Taro. I patch them."

Voss reached out and touched Taro's forehead.
A window popped up.

**> SYSTEM_UPDATE: PENDING...**
**> PATCH_NAME: PROJECT_DISSONANCE**
**> INSTALL? [Y/N]**

"You aren't a student anymore," Voss said. "And you aren't a civilian. You are a weapon. And weapons need to be tested."

"I don't want to be a weapon," Taro said.

"Then you should have died in that alley," Voss replied. "You survived the Void. That implies you are compatible with it. And that makes you very, very useful."

He pressed **[Y]**.

**> INSTALLING...**
**> WARNING: WARRANTY_VOID**
**> WARNING: PAIN_LIMITER_DISABLED**

The blue world turned red.
And then, for the first time since the crash, Taro felt something sharp.
