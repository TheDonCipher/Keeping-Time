### [TIME: 08:00:00] THE DEBUGGING SUITE

Taro woke up strapped to a table.

It wasn't a bed. A bed implies comfort. This was a **Diagnostic Slab**. A cold, white, composite surface designed to facilitate maximum data throughput from the subject's nervous system.

The room was aggressively High-Fidelity.
The walls were a perfect, seamless white. The lighting was shadowless, emanating from everywhere at once. It smelled of absolutely nothing—a sterile void of olfactory data.

**> RESTRAINTS: CLASS_5 [BIOMETRIC_LOCK]**
**> MASKING_FIELD: ACTIVE**

Taro tried to move his hands. The restraints didn't bulge. They weren't just physical; they were haptic dampeners. They canceled out any kinetic energy he tried to generate.

"Subject is online," a voice said.

It was a voice devoid of jitter. A pure Sine Wave.
Taro turned his head.

Standing over him was Headmaster Kael Voss.
He wasn't wearing his usual administrative robes. He was wearing a white, clinical "Debugger" suit. His face was obscured by a holographic visor streaming rapid-fire data.

"Head-Headmaster," Taro stammered. His voice felt thin. Weak. "Where... where am I?"

"You are in the Kernel," Voss said, not looking at him. He was manipulating a floating holographic display that showed a complex, jagged waveform. "Or rather, your data is. Your physical shell is in Medical Wing 4."

Voss swiped a hand through the hologram.
It was Taro's soul.
Or at least, the digital representation of it. A screaming, chaotic mess of red and yellow spikes.

"Look at this," Voss said, his tone one of professional disappointment. "This is your log from the Twilight Band. Do you know what this looks like to a system administrator?"

Taro stared at the jagged line. "It looks... loud."

"It looks like a virus," Voss corrected. "It looks like code injection. You didn't just break your limiter, Nishimura. You overwrote the local physics engine for three city blocks. We had to roll back the server state to a backup from 12 hours ago just to fix the pavement."

Voss tapped a key.
*PING.*

Pain shot through Taro's head. A sharp, digital spike.
**> ALERT: ADMIN_ACCESS [FORCED]**

"Stop!" Taro gasped.

"I am auditing your drivers," Voss said calmly. "I need to see where the corruption is rooted. Is it hardware? Or is it user error?"

He tapped again.
*PING.*

Memories flashed in Taro's mind. The alleyway. The Silence. The scream.
But viewed through Voss's filter, they looked different.
The scream wasn't heroic. It was ugly. A tear in the beautiful tapestry of the world.

"You are dangerous," Voss stated. "Not because you are strong. But because you are incompatible. You are a fatal error waiting to happen."

"They were going to kill us," Taro argued, his voice gaining a little gain. "The Silence... they were erasing us! I saved Hana! I saved Ven!"

"You damaged a Prefect's resonance core," Voss countered. "Hana Chord is currently in defragmentation therapy. She may never recall the color blue correctly again. And Ven? Ven is currently overheating in a cooling tank because you used him as a grounding wire for illegal voltage."

Taro froze.
"Are they...?"

"They are damaged. Because of you."

Voss stepped closer. The holographic visor vanished, revealing his eyes.
They were perfect. Golden. Terrifyingly calm.

"We cannot allow a Variable like you to run unchecked, Nishimura. You are a threat to the stability of the Concord. Standard protocol would be deletion."

Taro's heart hammered.
**> THREAT: TERMINATION**

"But," Voss continued, "Standard Protocol failed to predict you. Which means the System has a blind spot. And I do not like blind spots."

He reached into his pocket and pulled out a small, black chip.
It didn't glow. It looked like matte-black void glass.

"What is that?"

"A Patch," Voss said. "A limiter update. Custom-written for your... unique architecture. It will not just cap your output. It will regulate your waveform. It will force you into phase-alignment with the C-Order."

"You're going to lobotomize me," Taro whispered.

"I am going to fix you," Voss said. "I am going to make you compatible. You will still be Taro Nishimura. You will just be... quieter. Safer. Happier."

He held the chip over Taro's NAI port—the socket at the base of his skull.

"This is not a request," Voss said. "This is a mandatory update."

"No!" Taro struggled against the restraints. "I don't want it! I don't want to be quiet!"

"Chaos never does," Voss said softly.

He pressed the chip into the port.
*CLICK.*

Taro screamed.
This time, there was no sound.
The world went white.
Golden white.
Perfect.
Silent.
