# KEEPING TIME
## Chapter 4: The Medium

**ZONE: MALKUTH_ACADEMY_INTAKE**
**SYSTEM_LOAD: OPTIMAL**
**RESOLUTION: 8K [LOSSLESS]**
**STATUS: CONNECTED**

### [08:03:00] THE REFERENCE SIGNAL

The air at Malkuth didn't smell like air. It smelled like ionized ozone and expensive coolant fluid.

Taro stepped off the transport skiff and his Neural-Acoustic Interface instantly hard-reset to match the local protocol.

**> PROTCOL_HANDSHAKE: ACCEPTED**
**> LOCAL_RESOLUTION: ULTRA_HIGH**

The grainy, analog static of Sector 7-C was wiped away.
Replaced by **Definition**.

The Academy courtyard was a marvel of high-bandwidth rendering. The grid lines on the floor were laser-straight, accurate to the nanometer. The data floating in the air—schedules, frequency maps, student IDs—was rendered in lossless 8K resolution.

**> AMBIENT_PITCH: 440 Hz [STANDARD]**
**> JITTER: 0.000%**
**> PACKET_LOSS: 0.000%**

It felt like stepping inside a diamond. Cold. Sharp. Expensive.

Taro adjusted the collar of his new uniform. The fabric was stiff, laced with passive damping threads. His old analog headphones hung around his neck, unconnected. In this High-Fidelity zone, they felt archaic. Like bringing a stone tool to a semiconductor plant.

"Name?"

The voice hit him like a binary command. `1` or `0`. No float values.

Taro turned.

A girl stood at the intake kiosk.
To Taro's overloaded senses, she looked terrifyingly efficient.

**> TARGET: HANA_CHORD [PREFECT]**
**> WAVEFORM: SQUARE [RIGID]**
**> RISE_TIME: INSTANT**

Her aura wasn't a soft glow. It was a geometric fortress. Sharp 90-degree corners. Vertical rises. Instant drops.
A Square Wave.
The most efficient, unnatural sound in physics. It cut through the ambient air like a razor.

"Taro Nishimura," he said.

**> ANALYSIS: LATE**
**> TOLERANCE: ZERO**

"Intake closed at 0800," she said. Her voice matched her waveform. Flat. Clipped. "It is 0803. You are an error."

"My skiff got rerouted due to—"

"Irrelevant. Variables do not excuse outcomes."

She tapped her datapad. A red targeting reticle projected onto Taro's chest.
**> STATUS: MARKED [TARDY]**

"You are the anomaly from Sector 7," she said, looking up. Her eyes scanned him, and Taro felt the physical pressure of a **Deep Port Scan** rattling his firewall.

**> ALERT: EXTERNAL_PROBE_DETECTED**
**> SOURCE: H.CHORD**

"Your carrier wave is unstable," she noted, wrinkling her nose. "You are broadcasting variable noise across a calibrated platform. It is... messy."

**> TAG: DISGUST**

"I'm trying to clamp it," Taro said, tapping his thigh. *Tap-tap-tap.*
His internal clock was struggling to handshake with the local server time.
**> CLOCK_DRIFT: 40ms...**

"Stop fidgeting," Hana ordered. "It introduces mechanical variance."

"It's not fidgeting. It's manual calibration."

Hana paused.
The "Disgust" tag flickered and vanished.
**> ANALYSIS: RE-EVALUATING**

"Manual somatic calibration?" she asked.

"Yeah. Polyrhythm tap. 3 over 4. It compensates for the latency."

For the first time, Hana looked intrigued.
**> TAG: CURIOSITY [TECHNICAL]**

"Inefficient," she ruled. "But... structurally sound. You are running a legacy driver."

She stepped aside. The gate behind her dissolved into a cloud of green data particles.

"Proceed to Orientation. Lecture Hall B. Do not touch the walls. They are tuned to C-Sharp minor and your dissonance will smudge the finish."

### [08:15:00] THE PACKET STORM

The hallway was a wind tunnel of data.

Hundreds of students were moving toward the lecture halls. In the Lo-Fi zones, a crowd was just background noise. Here? It was a **Packet Storm**.

Taro's CPU spiked.

**> SYSTEM_LOAD: 98%**
**> THERMAL_WARNING: ACTIVE**

Every student was broadcasting high-definition telemetry.
The heavy **Bass Waves** of the structural engineering students shook the floorplates.
The sharp **Sawtooth** spikes of the Vanguard cadets cut through the air.
The flighty **Sine Waves** of the Choral students floated near the ceiling.

It was too much bandwidth. Taro stumbed. His vision started to artifact—green squares pixelating the edges of reality.

"Close your inputs," a voice ordered.

Taro blinked. Hana was walking beside him. Her rigid square-wave presence acted like a breakwater, cutting a clean, silent path through the chaotic data stream.

"You are processing the visual representation of the resonance," she said. "You do not have the RAM for that. Switch to `AUDIO_ONLY`."

"How?"

"Dampen your optic nerve. Focus on the carrier."

Taro squeezed his eyes shut. He focused on the NAI port at the base of his skull.
*throttle down.*

**> COMMAND: DISABLE_VIDEO_LAYER**
**> AUDIO_PROCESSING: ENHANCED**

The world went black.
And then... it opened up.

Taro didn't *see* the students anymore. He *heard* them.
Not as noise. As a Data Structure.
A massive, complex, shifting chord. He could feel the geometry of the room, defined by the acoustic reflections. He could feel where the empty seats were by the drop in impedance.

"Better?" Hana asked.

"Yeah," Taro breathed. "It's... cleaner."

"The Score is a tool, Nishimura. Do not let it overflow your buffer."

They entered the Lecture Hall.
Taro kept his visual layer disabled, navigating by the sound of echoes. He found a seat in a "quiet" spot—a dead zone near a concrete pillar—and sat down.

**> EVENT: ADMIN_LOGIN**
**> PRIORITY: ROOT**

The room went silent.
Instantly.
Not because people stopped talking. But because a signal just entered the room that had **Root Access**.

**> SOURCE: KAEL_UNISON [HEADMASTER]**
**> AUTHORITY: ABSOLUTE**

A single pulse hit them.
*Thump.*

It wasn't loud. But it had infinite mass.
Taro forced his visual layer open.

An old man stood on the dais.
His aura was immense. It didn't just surround him; it filled the volume of the room. They were sitting *inside* his resonant field.

**> WAVEFORM: FUNDAMENTAL [1 Hz]**

"Welcome," he said.
The text appeared in Taro's mind before the sound hit his ears. Zero latency.

"You have entered the Medium," the Headmaster said. "Out there, in the Twilight Band, you are 'Users'. You consume signal."

He looked up. For a second, the gold light of his eyes seemed to lock onto Taro.

"Here... you are **Architects**. You do not consume signal."

He raised a hand.
The entire physics engine of the room shifted.
The room rotated 90 degrees. Gravity followed.
The students gasped as the floor became the wall, and the wall became the floor.

**> PHYSICS_ENGINE: LOCAL_OVERRIDE**
**> VECTOR: ROTATED**

"You write it."

Taro looked at his hand.
The 880 Hz spark was there. Waiting.
It wasn't a glitch anymore.
It was a cursor. Blinking.

**> SYSTEM: READY.**
