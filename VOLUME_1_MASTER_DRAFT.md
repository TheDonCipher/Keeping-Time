# KEEPING TIME
## VOLUME 1: THE IMPULSE

---

### FRONT MATTER

**THE MAP**: [World of Ouroboros: Toroidal Projection]
**THE PREMISE**: In a world where sound is physics, frequency is law, and the "Unison Court" maintains a precarious silence, one boy’s interface glitches, revealing the code behind the curtain.

---

### CHAPTER 1: THE ZAP

> **STATUS: NAI BOOT SEQUENCE [INITIATING]**
> **CALIBRATION: FAILED**
> **VOICE: OVERRIDE**

Taro felt the vibration before he heard it—a needle of white heat threading through his spine. It was the Zap. The moment every citizen of the Unison districts dreaded and desired. 

"Steady," a voice said, muffled as if underwater. 

The world shattered. The grey walls of the clinic didn't just fade; they dissolved into a wireframe grid of cyan lines. Taro's vision was flooded with data. Floating labels snapped to every person in the room.

**> ID: DR. VERE [CLASS: CALIBRATOR]**
**> FREQUENCY: 440 Hz [STABLE]**
**> INTENT: CLINICAL [98%]**

But then, the glitch happened.

In the corner of his eye, a single note of pure, blinding gold erupted. It wasn't 440Hz. It was something higher. Faster. It was a 880Hz spike that shouldn't exist in a regulated zone.

**> ERROR: BUFFER_OVERFLOW [Type: Fatal]**
**> UNKNOWN_SIGNAL: [880.00 Hz]**

Taro reached for it, and the world screamed.

---

### CHAPTER 2: THE ASSESSMENT

> **LOCATION: UNISON HALL – RECOVERY WARD**
> **SYSTEM STATUS: SAFE_MODE**
> **DAMPING FIELD: ACTIVE [LEVEL 5]**

Taro woke up in the White Room. Technically, it was a Sensory Deprivation Chamber (Class A), but the street name was the White Room. For the first time in years, Taro was "Quiet."

"Diagnostic complete," a voice said. Adjutant Voss looked less like a human and more like a high-end peripheral.

"You executed an unauthorized overwrite," Voss said. "You didn't patch his signal. You deleted the carrier wave entirely. You bricked a Class-4 Vanguard unit in three frames."

Taro looked at his hands. He felt the phantom vibration of the 880 Hz—the urge to fix, to tune, to change. Option A was deletion; Option B was compilation.

"The transport leaves at 0800," Voss said, straightening his suit. "Read the manual, Taro. Learn the rules. Because if you break them again... we will simply turn you off."

---

### CHAPTER 3: MODULATION

> **ZONE: SECTOR 7-C RESIDENTIAL**
> **SIGNAL INTEGRITY: 15% [CRITICAL]**
> **INTERFERENCE: ANALOG_STATIC**

Taro stood outside the apartment door. The air in Sector 7-C was thick with Analog Interference. Inside, his father, Kael Nishimura, sat in a pool of perfect stillness.

"You have her frequency," Kael whispered. "The Fifth Harmonic. Unfiltered. Broadband." He slid a heavy, lead-lined case across the table. Inside was a set of heavy foam headphones. Vintage Analog.

Taro plugged the jack into his NAI's auxiliary port. *Click.* 

This was warm silence. No red error flags. No latency warnings. Just the dark, and a low, steady thrum in his chest. A raw, high-resolution sample of his own existence.

"Your signal," Taro said, his hand on the knob. "It's perfect."
"I know," Kael whispered. "That's the problem."

---

### [TECHNICAL INTERMISSION A]: THE POWER SYSTEM

**THE FIVE CORE VARIABLES**
Reality is not static; it is a stream of executable data modulated by five primary variables:

1. **Frequency (FRQ)**: Defines *what* the effect is.
2. **Phase (PHS)**: Defines *when* an effect occurs.
3. **Amplitude (AMP)**: The "Volume" or power output.
4. **Topology (TOP)**: The shape of the signal.
5. **Damping (DMP)**: The resistance/safety limits.

> **RULE 1**: Every edit to reality incurs a "Heat Cost." 
> **RULE 2**: Desync kills. If your intent doesn't match your output, the system crashes.

---

### CHAPTER 4: THE MEDIUM

> **ZONE: MALKUTH_ACADEMY_INTAKE**
> **RESOLUTION: 8K [LOSSLESS]**

The air at Malkuth smelled of ionized ozone. Taro’s interface hard-reset to match the local protocol. The grainy static of the slums was replaced by diamond-sharp 8K resolution.

Hana Chord, a prefect with a rigid Square Wave presence, marked him as a system error. "Your carrier wave is unstable," she noted.

Inside the Academy, Taro survived a Packet Storm by switching to `AUDIO_ONLY`, navigating the Hall by echoes. The Headmaster, Kael Unison, entered with Root Access. "Out there, you are Users," he told them. "Here... you are Architects. You do not consume signal. You write it."

---

### CHAPTER 5: THE SYNC CHECK

> **ZONE: THE_SANDBOX [TRAINING_DOJO]**
> **OBJECTIVE: TRIAD_HANDSHAKE**

Taro, Hana, and Ven stood in a triangle. The objective: a simple C-Major Triad. 

Taro’s 880 Hz jitters clipped Hana’s shield. "You are screaming raw data!" she snapped. Taro signal spiked to 95%. The white-hot bolt missed Hana and slammed into Ven. 

Ven was a Sink—he ate the signal. Taro’s energy converted into Pure Bass. "Whoa," Ven rumbled, his buffer finally clear. Hana stared at the telemetry. It was a Drop. Lethal-grade signal saturation. "Forget the Triad," she decided. "Let's see how much bass we can generate."

---

### [TECHNICAL INTERMISSION B]: THE HARDWARE

**1. NEURAL-ACOUSTIC INTERFACE (NAI)**: Biomechanical implant paired with retinal projectors.
**2. CALIBRATION BANDS**: Standard-issue limiters that absorb excess resonance as a Heat Sink.
**3. DECKS**: Modulators that shape the signal from the NAI (Precision, Amplifier, Hybrid).

---

### CHAPTER 6: THE GROUND STATE

> **ZONE: ACADEMY_BASEMENT [SECTION 0]**
> **STATUS: VENTING**

In the Academy's Grounding Vault, Ven sat at 98% thermal load. "You didn't overload me," Ven corrected. "You filled me."

They formed a Hardline Link. When Taro grabbed Ven's hand, the buzzing in his head drained away. "Hana aims. You shoot. I hold the gun," Ven said. For the first time, Taro was stable.

---

### CHAPTER 7: THE RIVAL

> **OPPONENT: MARCUS_STACCATO**
> **MODE: LIVE_FIRE**

Marcus Staccato, a Year 2 Rhythm Operator, moved at 140 BPM with zero latency. 

"You operate on analog time," Marcus said, parrying Taro’s sawtooth waves with a Tempo Rod. Marcus trapped Taro in a Rhythm Cage. Taro lost not from lack of power, but from lack of tempo.

---

### CHAPTER 8: THE SORTIE

> **ZONE: SECTOR_4 [TWILIGHT_BAND]**
> **FILTER: GOLDEN_AGE_V2**

Sector 4 looked like a golden paradise through The Score, but Taro saw the rot beneath. The "Golden Age" filter was erasing the starving residents. 

"It's people, Hana," Taro argued. "They're broadcasting pain."
At a Resonance Node, Taro saw black static and the symbol of "The Silence." They weren't patrolling; they were being hunted.

---

### [TECHNICAL INTERMISSION C]: THE FACTIONS

**1. C-ORDER**: Seek absolute stability (C-Note).
**2. G-VANGUARD**: Enforcers of superior tempo (Grid Time).
**3. F-REBELS**: Signal-pirates who believe in the variable.
**4. THE SILENCE**: A cult seeking perfect, empty quiet.

---

### CHAPTER 9: THE SILENCE

> **SIGNAL_RETURN: NULL**
> **SYSTEM_STATUS: ERROR**

The Silence agents sucked the broadband out of the air. Taro pulled his Analog Headphones up—copper warmth replaced the digital screaming. 

Hana's pulse fire was split by a Silence agent's knife. "They aren't immune to physics," Taro realized. He used kinetic clanging to disorient them. "Run!"

---

### CHAPTER 10: THE BREACH

> **ZONE: [REDACTED]**
> **STATUS: UNSHIELDED**

Cornered. Taro told Ven to drop the ground link. "I need to unmask." 

Taro snapped the silver limiter off his neck. *CRACK.* A massive, golden Sawtooth Wave erupted, shattering the Dead Zone and unspooling the geometry of the alley. The operating system of reality died. Taro saw the screaming abyss: The Source Code.

---

### CHAPTER 11: THE BLUE SCREEN

> **SYSTEM_INTEGRITY: 0%**
> **STATUS: SAFE_MODE**

Taro hit the vibrating field of raw probability. "Reboot!" Ven roared. Taro built a grid in his inner ear. **> SAFE_MODE: ENGAGED**. 

The world turned into wireframe meshes. The sky was blue static: **[TEXTURE_MISSING]**. 

---

### [TECHNICAL INTERMISSION D]: VISUAL STATES

**1. STANDARD**: High-Fidelity AR.
**2. SAFE MODE**: Wireframe meshes/BIOS Blue.
**3. THE VOID**: Raw, non-Euclidean static.
**4. DISSONANCE VISION**: Seeing internal "Ghost Layers" and structural source code.

---

### CHAPTER 12: THE AUDIT

> **RENDER_MODE: SAFE [BIOS_LEVEL]**

Taro lay in a low-poly ward. Adjutant Voss reviewed the crash: 3 million output. "You broke the math," Voss said. He initiated a patch: **PROJECT_DISSONANCE**.

---

### CHAPTER 13: THE PATCH

> **STATUS: REBOOTING...**

Textures violently paved over the blue wireframe. Taro saw Voss's internal organs—a schematic of arteries and nerves. "There is no Safe Mode anymore," Voss warned. "The next crash is fatal."

Taro reunited with his team. He lied about the patch, claiming it was an upgrade. But he saw the structural fatigue in the world. He saw where to hit it.

---

### CHAPTER 14: THE RETURN

> **DRIVER_VERSION: 2.0 (PATCHED)**

The world was a mess of conflicting frequencies. Taro spotted a senior cadet flickering blue static—she wasn't real. The glitch was everywhere.

---

### CHAPTER 15: THE PHANTOM MESH

> **RESONANCE_DYSPHORIA: ACTIVE**

Taro's face popped in the mirror, revealing a jagged wireframe. He found "The Tank," Kimura, playing cello. Her hull flickered to reveal a slender light-mesh. Her name was Elara.

---

### CHAPTER 16: ILLEGAL MODULATIONS

> **AUDIO_STATUS: SOUNDPROOFING_MAX**

Elara showed Taro a jailbroken UI. The C-Order forces a sine wave over their raw signals. Elara wrote a custom driver to let her signal flow. She gave Taro a key to "The Null"—a signal-free club.

---

### CHAPTER 17: THE UNDERGROUND

> **LOCATION: THE NULL**

In the signal-free air, Elara became a being of neon-blue glass. Taro dropped his mask and became a silhouette—a hole in reality. 

"The Void," Elara whispered. He was the *rest* between the measures. For the first time, Taro felt necessary.

---

### [TECHNICAL INTERMISSION E]: THE MASKING MECHANIC

**1. THE HULL**: The assigned 3D skin.
**2. THE MESH**: The raw wireframe of the self.
**3. MASKING**: The intensive CPU process of forcing a signal into a pattern.
**4. RETUNING**: Modifying the kernel to allow the Mesh to dictate the Hull.
