# OUROBOROS: DIRECT PAYMENT INFRASTRUCTURE
## PayPal & Crypto Monetization Guide

Since Patreon is unavailable, we will use a **Direct Support** model. This allows you to retain a higher percentage of revenue and accept global payments, including crypto.

### 1. The PayPal "Tip Jar" & Subscriptions
- **Implementation**: Embed a "Support the Architect" button on your website.
- **Tools**: **PayPal Buttons** or **PayPal Subscriptions**.
- **The Hook**: "Pay what you want" for early access to chapters.

### 2. The Crypto Gateway (Web3 Support)
- **Direct Wallet**: List your **ETH/SOL/USDC** address on the portal for direct one-time donations.
- **Gated Hosting**: Use **Helium** or **Mirror.xyz** to post "Gated Chapters" that only unlock if a user holds a specific token or sends a micro-payment in crypto.
- **Value**: Perfect for the "High-Fi" world of Ouroboros. It feels in-character for users to pay with "Digital Frequencies."

### 3. Tiered Rewards (Direct Delivery)
Without Patreon's automated tiers, you can use **Email Automation**:
- **TIER 1 (Listener)**: $5/mo via PayPal -> Automated email with the week's secret lore.
- **TIER 2 (Vanguard)**: $20/mo -> Access to a private Discord/Telegram group and the "Forbidden Specs."

### RECOMMENDATION:
Use **Gumroad** or **Buy Me a Coffee**. Even if Patreon is banned, these platforms often accept PayPal and have fewer regional restrictions. They allow for both "Subscription" and "Single Product" (PDF shop) models.
